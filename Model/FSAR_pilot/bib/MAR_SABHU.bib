	abstract = {Globally, economies and marine ecosystems are increasingly dependent on sustainable fisheries management (SFM) to balance social, economic, and conservation needs. The overarching objectives of SFM are to maximize both conservation and socio-economic benefits, while minimizing short-term socio-economic costs. A number of tools have been developed to achieve SFM objectives, ranging from fishery specific to ecosystem-based strategies. Closures are a common SFM tool used to balance the trade-off between socio-economic and conservation considerations; they vary in scope from small-scale temporary closures to large-scale permanent networks. Unfortunately, closures are frequently implemented without a plan for monitoring or assessing whether SFM objectives are met. In situations in which a monitoring plan is not in place we propose that commonly available fishery data can often be used to evaluate whether management tools are effective in meeting SFM objectives. Here, we present a case study of closures on Georges Bank that shows how fishery data can be analyzed to perform such an assessment. Since 2006, on the Canadian side of Georges Bank, seasonal scallop fishery closures have been implemented with the aim of reducing by-catch of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea) during spawning. In lieu of data from a dedicated monitoring program, we analyzed data from Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), fishery logbooks, and a scallop survey to assess the impact of these closures on the scallop fishery, and use observer data (i.e. by-catch) to assess the effectiveness of these closures in meeting their conservation objective. While compliance for these time-area closures was high, the closures did not significantly displace fishing activity and overall there was limited evidence of an impact on the scallop fishery. Further, the discard rates for both cod and yellowtail were above average when their respective closures were active. These results suggest that improvements to the closures design and/or other measures may be required to achieve the desired SFM objectives.},

For example, fisheries targeting large individuals are expected to select for early maturation at smaller sizes, leading to reduced fecundity and thus also reduced fisheries yield.

Here, we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution. Responses to selective harvesting will depend on species-specific life-history traits, and on community-level and environmental processes. Therefore, the detection of fisheries-induced evolution and successful fish stock management requires routine population monitoring, and a good understanding of genetics, relevant ecological processes and changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf is experiencing rapid warming, with potentially profound consequences to marine ecosystems. While satellites document multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability on the surface, our understanding of the status, trends, and drivers of the benthic environmental change remains limited. We interpolated sparse benthic temperature data along the New England Shelf and upper Slope using a seasonally dynamic, regionally specific multiple linear regression model that merged in situ and remote sensing data. The statistical model predicted nearly 90\% of the variability of the data, resulting in a synoptic time series spanning over three decades from 1982 to 2014. Benthic temperatures increased throughout the domain, including in the Gulf of Maine. Rates of benthic warming ranged from 0.1 to 0.4°C per decade, with fastest rates occurring in shallow, nearshore regions and on Georges Bank, the latter exceeding rates observed in the surface. Rates of benthic warming were up to 1.6 times faster in winter than the rest of the year in many regions, with important implications for disease occurrence and energetics of overwintering species. Drivers of warming varied over the domain. In southern New England and the mid-Atlantic shallow Shelf regions, benthic warming was tightly coupled to changes in SST, whereas both regional and basin-scale changes in ocean circulation affect temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, the Continental Shelf, and Georges Banks. These results highlight data gaps, the current feasibility of prediction from remotely sensed variables, and the need for improved understanding on how climate may affect seasonally specific ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Aim Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting species’ habitat suitability and species’ probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. Location Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin. Methods We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non-spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm-specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non-spatial SDMs (10\%–50\% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans. Results Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non-spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. Main conclusions Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.},

	abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to address a wide range of theoretical and applied questions in the terrestrial realm, but marine-based applications remain relatively scarce. In this review, we consider how conceptual and practical issues associated with terrestrial SDMs apply to a range of marine organisms and highlight the challenges relevant to improving marine SDMs. Location We include studies from both marine and terrestrial systems that encompass many geographic locations around the globe. Methods We first performed a literature search and analysis of marine and terrestrial SDMs in ISI Web of Science to assess trends and applications. Using knowledge from terrestrial applications, we critically evaluate the application of SDMs in marine systems in the context of ecological factors (dispersal, species interactions, aggregation and ontogenetic shifts) and practical considerations (data quality, alternative modelling approaches and model validation) that facilitate or create difficulties for model application. Results The relative importance of ecological factors to be considered when applying SDMs varies among terrestrial and marine organisms. Correctly incorporating dispersal is frequently considered an important issue for terrestrial models, but because there is greater potential for dispersal in the ocean, it is often less of a concern in marine SDMs. By contrast, ontogenetic shifts and feeding have received little attention in terrestrial SDM applications, but these factors are important to many marine SDMs. Opportunities also exist for applying more advanced SDM approaches in the marine realm, including mechanistic ecophysiological models, where water balance and heat transfer equations are simpler for some marine organisms relative to their terrestrial counterparts. Main conclusions SDMs have generally been under-utilized in the marine realm relative to terrestrial applications. Correlative SDM methods should be tested on a range of marine organisms, and we suggest further development of methods that address ontogenetic shifts and feeding interactions. We anticipate developments in, and cross-fertilization between, coupled correlative and process-based SDMs, mechanistic eco-physiological SDMs, and spatial population dynamic models for climate change and species invasion applications in particular. Comparisons of the outputs of different model types will provide insight that is useful for improved spatial management of marine species.},

	abstract = {1. The juvenile stages of fish are often dependent on specific habitat types for their survival. Protecting these habitats may be crucial for maintaining strong adult stocks. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union offers protection of marine habitats that are essential for the recruitment of many fish species. By protecting these critical habitats the network may be important for maintaining the stocks of these fish species. 2. We present a spatially explicit, GIS-based, assessment of two important components of the ecological coherence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks: representativity and connectivity. Representativity can be measured as the proportion of each conservation feature that is protected, whereas connectivity assesses the spatial configuration of the network. We apply these analyses to study the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network in a 30 000-km2 archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with respect to a coastal fish assemblage and associated habitats. The analyses are based on fish distribution maps that have been constructed by statistically relating life stage specific occurrence to environmental variables, and thereafter making spatial predictions based on maps of the environmental variables. 3. The map-based analyses show that both the representativity and the connectivity of the network are poor with respect to the studied fish species. In total, 3·5\% (11 km2) of the assemblage recruitment habitat was protected and 48\% of the potentially connected habitats were included in the MPA network. 4. The assessment explicitly identified geographical areas, visually communicated using maps, where the network should be improved to ensure ecological coherence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Many MPA networks around the world, such as the Natura 2000 network in Europe, have recently come into effect. Establishment of the networks has often been governed by opportunity rather than by strict ecological analyses, primarily because distribution maps of species and habitats have been unavailable. Map-based assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of evolving MPA networks, such as the one presented here, are needed in adaptive management. They can provide an efficient tool for visualising and communicating the results to stakeholders and policy makers in the process of working towards ecological coherence.},

	abstract = {Aim Interest in species distribution models (SDMs) and related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000. The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a broad range of applications using the package was explored within the first 8 years following its release. The purpose of this study is to clarify these early developments and initial applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing relevance to current studies. Location Mainly Australia and New Zealand, but also some global applications. Methods We outline the development of the bioclim package, early applications (1984–1991) and its current relevance. Results bioclim was the first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography, such as quantifying the environmental niche of species, identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of climate change on species distributions. Main conclusions Understanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables are used in about 76\% of recent published MaxEnt analyses of terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change, are still highly relevant to key conservation biogeography issues.},

	abstract = {The use of complex statistical models has recently increased substantially in the context of species distribution behavior. This complexity has made the inferential and predictive processes challenging to perform. The Bayesian approach has become a good option to deal with these models due to the ease with which prior information can be incorporated along with the fact that it provides a more realistic and accurate estimation of uncertainty. In this paper, we first review the sources of information and different approaches (frequentist and Bayesian) to model the distribution of a species. We also discuss the Integrated Nested Laplace approximation as a tool with which to obtain marginal posterior distributions of the parameters involved in these models. We finally discuss some important statistical issues that arise when researchers use species data: the presence of a temporal effect (presenting different spatial and spatio-temporal structures), preferential sampling, spatial misalignment, non-stationarity, imperfect detection, and the excess of zeros.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models are a fundamental tool in ecology, conservation biology, and biogeography and typically identify potential species distributions using static phenomenological models. We demonstrate the importance of complementing these popular models with spatially explicit, dynamic mechanistic models that link potential and realized distributions. We develop general grid-based, pattern-oriented spread models incorporating three mechanisms—plant population growth, local dispersal, and long-distance dispersal—to predict broadscale spread patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. We use the model to examine the spread of the invasive Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental bittersweet) by Sturnus vulgaris (European starling) across northeastern North America. We find excellent quantitative agreement with historical spread records over the last century that are critically linked to the geometry of heterogeneous landscapes and each of the explanatory mechanisms considered. Spread of bittersweet before 1960 was primarily driven by high growth rates in developed and agricultural landscapes, while subsequent spread was mediated by expansion into deciduous and coniferous forests. Large, continuous patches of coniferous forests may substantially impede invasion. The success of C. orbiculatus and its potential mutualism with S. vulgaris suggest troubling predictions for the spread of other invasive, fleshy-fruited plant species across northeastern North America.},

	abstract = {Aim Spatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence–absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework. Innovation We develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a ‘joint, dynamic SDM’ (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more ‘factors’. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package. Main conclusions Case study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the ‘flight curves’ typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.},

Using both actual data and simulations, we explored two approaches to the stock assessment of Georges Bank Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus), where fishery closures were implemented in December 1994. One approach modeled the stock in “aggregate”, using domed commercial selectivity functions for the time periods when the MPAs were closed to scallop fishing. In the second “split” approach, separate models were used for the scallops inside (closed areas) and outside (open areas) the MPAs. The aggregate model converged only in 17\% of the simulated runs, compared with 93\% convergence for the open and closed runs using the split approach. With actual data, and in those simulations where both methods converged, the two approaches gave similar results, although biomass estimates in the most recent years from the aggregate model tended to be biased low. The closed area model, and to a lesser extent the aggregate model, estimated natural mortality M fairly precisely, but open area model estimates of M were poorly defined. Retrospective patterns were reduced using the split approach and when natural mortality was estimated. We conclude that the split assessment approach is better for sea scallops, but it may be best to use both approaches for comparative purposes.},

We extend the recent penalized complexity prior framework and develop a principled joint prior for the range and the marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional Matérn GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and penalizes complexity by shrinking the range toward infinity and the marginal variance toward zero. We propose guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters, and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage.We extend the prior to a nonstationary GRF parameterized through local ranges and marginal standard deviations, and introduce a scheme for selecting the hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated stationary data. The approach is applied to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters leads to conservative estimates of nonstationarity and improved predictive performance over the stationary model.

Improved SDMs, which account for biotic factors and do not require a priori knowledge on species interactions, are needed to fully understand species distributions. Here, we model the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on species distribution patterns and explore the robustness of distributions under future climate change. We fit hierarchical spatial models using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for lagomorph species throughout Europe and test the predictive ability of models containing only abiotic factors against models containing abiotic and biotic factors. We account for residual spatial autocorrelation using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Model outputs are used to estimate areas in which abiotic and biotic factors determine species’ ranges. INLA models containing both abiotic and biotic factors had substantially better predictive ability than models containing abiotic factors only, for all but one of the four species. In models containing abiotic and biotic factors, both appeared equally important as determinants of lagomorph ranges, but the influences were spatially heterogeneous. Parts of widespread lagomorph ranges highly influenced by biotic factors will be less robust to future changes in climate, whereas parts of more localised species ranges highly influenced by the environment may be less robust to future climate. SDMs that do not explicitly include biotic factors are potentially misleading and omit a very important source of variation. For the field of species distribution modelling to advance, biotic factors must be taken into account in order to improve the reliability of predicting species distribution patterns both presently and under future climate change.},

	abstract = {Species distribution shifts are a widely reported biological consequence of climate-driven warming across marine ecosystems, creating ecological and social challenges. To meet these challenges and inform management decisions, we need accurate projections of species distributions. Quantitative species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely used to make these projections, while qualitative climate change vulnerability assessments are becoming more common. We constructed SDMs, compared SDM projections to expectations from a qualitative expert climate change vulnerability assessment, and developed a novel approach for combining the two methods to project the distribution and relative biomass of 49 marine species in the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem under a “business as usual” climate change scenario. A forecasting experiment using SDMs highlighted their ability to capture relative biomass patterns fairly well (mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted and observed biomass = 0.24, range = 0–0.6) and pointed to areas needing improvement, including reducing prediction error and better capturing fine-scale spatial variability. SDM projections suggest the region will undergo considerable biological changes, especially in the Gulf of Maine, where commercially-important groundfish and traditional forage species are expected to decline as coastal fish species and warmer-water forage species historically found in the southern New England/Mid-Atlantic Bight area increase. The SDM projections only occasionally aligned with vulnerability assessment expectations, with agreement more common for species with adult mobility and population growth rates that showed low sensitivity to climate change. Although our blended approach tried to build from the strengths of each method, it had no noticeable improvement in predictive ability over SDMs. This work rigorously evaluates the predictive ability of SDMs, quantifies expected species distribution shifts under future climate conditions, and tests a new approach for integrating SDMs and vulnerability assessments to help address the complex challenges arising from climate-driven species distribution shifts.},

The aim here is to characterize the temporal patterns of discarding practices in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) from 1994 to 2008. Trend and seasonality were explored in discards per unit effort (dpue) of haddock (Melanogrammus aegleﬁnus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and cod (Gadus morhua) through Bayesian harmonic regression (HREG) models. The HREG models reveal discarding of all three species in annual cycles, with a peak in the second quarter, perhaps reﬂecting species biology or ﬁsher behaviour, or both. The dpue of cod cycled around a constant level throughout the observation period, but whiting and haddock dpue increased.},

Bycatch analyses that use fishery-dependent data only reflect the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of turtles and fishing effort and therefore do not directly reveal conditions associated with turtle distributions. Fisheryindependent and -dependent data can be used together to identify environmental conditions associated with turtle presence and the subsequent risk of a bycatch encounter if fishing effort is present. We developed generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe fishery-independent encounter rates of loggerheads observed in aerial and resource surveys in the US mid-Atlantic region as a function of environmental variables. We then fit a fishery-independent GAM to fishery-dependent data collected from commercial gillnet, bottom trawl, and scallop dredge fisheries in the midAtlantic region, and tested the model on new fishery-dependent data to assess how well the model predicted bycatch events. The preferred model describes fishery-independent encounter rates as a function of latitude, sea-surface temperature, depth, and salinity. When this model was fit to fishery-dependent data and tested on new data, it predicted 85\% of the observed bycatch events when grouped by latitude and season, although it underestimated bycatch events in southern latitudes in winter. We identify times and areas of elevated bycatch risk on which to focus future conservation efforts and observer coverage.},

We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs) represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM component context. We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal ‘across-the-function’ frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints.},

	abstract = {Management of individual species in a multi-species fishery poses a number of challenges for fishery management systems, including the problem of managing fish bycatch. Fish bycatch is sometimes identified as a particular problem associated with management systems based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs) but this has not always proven to be correct. Since the introduction of an ITQ-based fishery management system 15 years ago, New Zealand has used a number of mechanisms to manage fish bycatch, with variable success. In 2001, the system by which fishers’ catches are balanced against their catching rights was significantly modified. Changes include the implementation of a fee schedule requiring fishers to pay higher fees for increased levels of catch in excess of the catching right they hold. This is designed to provide fishers with an economic disincentive to target fish stocks for which they have no catching right. The new catch-balancing regime has only been in operation for 8 months but initial results are encouraging. There are anecdotal reports of fishers shifting to alternative fishing grounds to avoid catching species for which they have insufficient catching rights and there is no evidence of increased discarding. The real test of the regime will occur when a shortage of catching rights for a bycatch species severely constrains a major target fishery.},

Spatially explicit population models are helpful to managers because these models consider both species-habitat relationships and the arrangement of habitats in space and time. The visualizations that typically accompany spatially explicit models also permit managers to 'see' the effects of alternative management strategies on populations of interest. However, the expense entailed in developing the data bases required for spatially explicit models may limit widespread implementation. In addition, many of the models are developed for one or a few species, and dealing with multiple species in a landscape remains a significant challenge. To be most useful to land managers, spatially explicit population models should be user friendly, easily portable, operate on spatial and temporal scales appropriate to management decisions, and use input and output variables that can be measured affordably.},

	abstract = {Niche-based approaches to community analysis often involve estimating a matrix of pairwise interactions among species (the “community matrix”), but this task becomes infeasible using observational data as the number of modeled species increases. As an alternative, neutral theories achieve parsimony by assuming that species within a trophic level are exchangeable, but generally cannot incorporate stabilizing interactions even when they are evident in field data. Finally, both regulated (niche) and unregulated (neutral) approaches have rarely been fitted directly to survey data using spatiotemporal statistical methods. We therefore propose a spatiotemporal and model-based approach to estimate community dynamics that are partially regulated. Specifically, we start with a neutral spatiotemporal model where all species follow ecological drift, which precludes estimating pairwise interactions. We then add regulatory relations until model selection favors stopping, where the “rank” of the interaction matrix may range from zero to the number of species. A simulation experiment shows that model selection can accurately identify the rank of the interaction matrix, and that the identified spatiotemporal model can estimate the magnitude of species interactions. A 40-yr case study for the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine community shows that recovering grey seals have an unregulated and negative relationship with demersal fishes. We therefore conclude that partial regulation is a plausible approximation to community dynamics using field data and hypothesize that estimating partial regulation will be expedient in future analyses of spatiotemporal community dynamics given limited field data. We conclude by recommending ongoing research to add explicit models for movement, so that meta-community theory can be confronted with data in a spatiotemporal statistical framework.},

	abstract = {Protected and managed species, including harvested fishes, exhibit spatial and temporal variation in their distribution and productivity. Spatio-temporal variation can arise from differences in habitat quality, human impacts (including harvest), density-dependent changes in per capita productivity, as well as individual movement. Human impacts (e.g. direct harvest) also vary spatially and over time, and monitoring the overlap between impacts and population distribution is necessary to ensure that human impacts are sustainable and to prioritize research and management for populations that are heavily impacted. However, estimating spatio-temporal variation in human impacts and population dynamics while accounting for individual movement has remained computationally challenging for decades. We developed a spatial population growth (also known as ‘surplus production’) model that is inspired by finite element analysis, which estimates spatio-temporal population dynamics given density-dependent population regulation, individual movement and spatially explicit harvest. We demonstrate the method using data for big skate Raja binoculata in the California Current from 2003 to 2013 and demonstrate that results can be processed to estimate an upper limit on sustainable harvest (an ‘overfishing limit’). We also conduct a simulation experiment to explore the small-sample properties of parameter estimates. A simulation experiment confirms that real-world sample sizes are sufficient to estimate the sustainable harvest level within 20\% of its actual value. However, sample sizes are likely insufficient to reliably estimate movement rates. The spatial population growth model estimates an overfishing limit of 740–890 metric tonnes for big skate from 2010 to 2013, compared with annual harvest {\textless}100 tonnes. This suggests that recent harvest of big skate is likely sustainable, and sensitivity analysis confirms that this conclusion is robust to different potential rates for individual movement. Synthesis and applications. We recommend that spatio-temporal population models be used across systems and taxa to monitor the spatial overlap between species distribution and human impacts. For big skate, we recommend management rules triggering additional data collection and assessment effort if harvest rates substantially increase. We also recommend future research regarding spatial management regulations for emerging fisheries.},

This involves developing a spatial model which includes spatially explicit trends in recruitment, fishing mortality and rates of movement. The model is over-parameterized but provides good fits to the data for snow crab. It was used to simulate data sets to test the ability of a non-spatially structured (aggregate) assessment method in terms of estimating trends in abundance and fishing pressure in the presence of spatial structure. The aggregate assessment method performed well if survey selectivity was well known, but was unable to reliably represent the dynamics of the population without data on survey selectivity. Additional data on movement from tagging studies or winter surveys would be useful to improve the understanding of the influence of spatial structure on snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea.},

	abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

Spatially-structured stock assessment methods can reduce the bias and imprecision in the estimates of management-related model outputs. However, their performance has only recently been evaluated formally, in particular when some of the area fished is closed. In order to evaluate the effects of closed areas and spatial variation in growth and exploitation rate when estimating spawning biomass, a spatially-explicit operating model was developed to simulate spatial data, and five configurations of the stock assessment package Stock Synthesis (three of which were spatially structured) were applied. The bias in estimates of spawning stock biomass associated with spatially-aggregated assessment methods increases in the presence of closed areas while these biases can be reduced (or even eliminated) by applying appropriately constructed spatially-structured stock assessments. The performance of spatially-aggregated assessments when estimating spawning stock biomass is found to depend on the interactions among spatial variation in growth, in exploitation rate, and in knowledge of the spatial areas over which growth and exploitation rate are homogeneous.},

	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

Time block periods, or penalty weights associated with time-varying selectivity parameters, are subjective and often developed on an ad hoc basis. A factorial simulation–estimation experiment, with discrete or continuous changes in selectivity, is conducted to determine the best practices for modeling time-varying selectivity in fisheries stock assessments.

However, most studies exploring the impact of ignoring spatial structure in stock assessments have developed population models with multiple subpopulations, rather than exploring the impact spatial dynamics may have on performance of non-spatially structured assessment methods. Furthermore, the data available for stock assessments usually do not include tagging or other data necessary to estimate movement rates. One solution to this problem is to include several fleets, each with a different selectivity pattern to represent availability, within a spatially-aggregated assessment method. In this study, the impacts of ignoring spatial structure, and the effectiveness of using multiple selectivity patterns as a proxy for spatial structure, are evaluated for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (or California sardine; Sardinops sagax). A spatially-explicit operating model is used to explore three spatial factors: the existence of size-dependent seasonal migrations across large geographical areas, the influx of another stock into the area of the assessed stock, and the occurrence of recruitment outside the area where it is assumed to occur. Two other factors related to data were evaluated: data availability and data collection design. The assessment model (AM) is based on the 2010 stock assessment for Pacific sardine, implemented in Stock Synthesis, and includes two seasons per year and six fleets, each with a different selectivity pattern. Ignoring spatial structure is found to negatively impact estimation performance, with seasonal movement having the largest impact. The AM compensates for ignoring movement and spatial structure by adjusting the selectivity patterns, but selectivity alone is not able to account for all biases caused by spatial structure.},

	abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},

The model incorporates stock structure, seasonal migration, predation, Allee effects, and variation in natural mortality. The simulated dynamics of two substocks were compared under three management options: (1) historical catch levels; (2) combined management (substocks are managed as one unit) with a constant fishing mortality rate (F) of 0.4; and (3) separated management (substocks are managed individually) with the same F level. Three major conclusions emerged from the simulations. First, the population dynamics under historical catch levels tended to vary widely from complete extinction to a fourfold increase. Second, constant-F management produced stable population dynamics, reduced the probability of stock decline, and yielded a higher average catch. Third, the combined management option resulted in overfishing the more vulnerable substock; separated management helped to prevent the more vulnerable substock from collapse, but its performance was compromised when there was net immigration to the more vulnerable substock.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Spatially explicit population models are becoming increasingly useful tools for population ecologists, conservation biologists, and land managers. Models are spatially explicit when they combine a population simulator with a landscape map that describes the spatial distribution of landscape features. With this map, the locations of habitat patches, individuals, and other items of interest are explicitly incorporated into the model, and the effect of changing landscape features on population dynamics can be studied. In this paper we describe the structure of some spatially explicit models under development and provide examples of current and future research using these models. Spatially explicit models are important tools for investigating scale-related questions in population ecology, especially the response of organisms to habitat change occurring at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Simulation models that incorporate real-world landscapes, as portrayed by landscape maps created with geographic information systems, are also proving to be crucial in the development of management strategies in response to regional land-use and other global change processes. Spatially explicit population models will increase our ability to accurately model complex landscapes, and therefore should improve both basic ecological knowledge of landscape phenomena and applications of landscape ecology to conservation and management.},

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

Today, the iconic cod (Gadus morhua) remains at low levels, while Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) has been increasing since the mid-2000s, concomitant with increasing interest from the fishing industry. Currently, our knowledge about halibut ecology is limited, and the lack of recovery in other collapsed groundfish populations has highlighted the danger of overfishing local concentrations. Here, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal approach to model the spatial structure of juvenile Atlantic halibut over 36 years and three fisheries management regimes using three model parameters to characterize the resulting spatiotemporal abundance structure: persistence (similarity of spatial structure over time), connectivity (coherence of temporal pattern over space), and spatial variance (variation across the seascape). Two areas of high juvenile abundance persisted through three decades whereas two in the northeast are now diminished, despite the increased abundance and landings throughout the management units. The persistent areas overlap with full and seasonal area closures, which may act as refuges from fishing. Connectivity was estimated to be 250 km, an order of magnitude less than the distance assumed by the definition of the Canadian management units ( 2,000 km). The underlying question of whether there are distinct populations within the southern stock unit cannot be answered with this model, but the smaller 250 km scale of coherent temporal patterns suggests more complex population structure than previously thought, which should be taken into consideration by fishery management.},

	abstract = {Ignoring spatial population structure in the development of fisheries management advice can affect population resilience and yield. However, the resources required to develop spatial stock assessment models that match the spatial scale of management are often unavailable. As a result, quota recommendations from spatially aggregated assessment models are commonly divided among management areas based on empirical methods. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to 1) explore how variation in population structure influences the spatial distribution of harvest that produces maximum system yield, and 2) contrast the performance of empirical quota allocation methods in approximating ideal spatial harvest strategies. Spatial scenarios that included post-recruitment movement resulted in a broader range of spatial management options (e.g., setting regional total allowable catch) that achieved near maximum system yield compared to scenarios without movement. Stochastic projections showed that using the proportion of total survey biomass in each management area to spatially allocate quota performed best for maximizing system yield when the true spatial structure was unknown, considerably outperforming equal allocation and allocation based on a recruitment index. However, with all methods, area-specific harvest rates sometimes led to unintended depletion within management units. Improved data and understanding of spatial stock dynamics can reduce the need for ad hoc approaches for spatial harvest allocation, allow for a greater range of management options, and increase the efficacy of spatial management procedures.},

Fishing, in addition to simply removing biomass, also truncates the age and size structure of fish populations and often results in localized depletions. We summarize recent research suggesting that an old-growth age structure, combined with a broad spatial distribution of spawning and recruitment, is at least as important as spawning biomass in maintaining long-term sustainable population levels. In particular, there is evidence that older, larger female rockfishes produce larvae that withstand starvation longer and grow faster than the offspring of younger fish, that stocks may actually consist of several reproductively isolated units, and that recruitment may come from only a small and different fraction of the spawning population each year. None of these phenomena is accounted for in current management programs. We examine alternative management measures that address these specific issues and conclude that the best and perhaps only way to ensure old-growth age structure and complex spatial structure in populations of groundfish is through interconnected networks of marine reserves.},

A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

However, species distribution models and population dynamic models have rarely been integrated into a single modelling framework. Consequently, fine-scale spatial heterogeneity is often ignored in resource assessments. We develop and test a novel spatiotemporal assessment framework to better address fine-scale spatial heterogeneities based on theories of fish population dynamic and spatiotemporal statistics. The spatiotemporal model links species distribution and population dynamic models within a single statistical framework that is flexible enough to permit inference for each state variable through space and time. We illustrate the model with a simulation–estimation experiment tailored to two exploited marine species: snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio, Oregoniidae) in the Eastern Bering Sea and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis, Pandalidae) in the Gulf of Maine. These two species have different types of life history. We compare the spatiotemporal model with a spatially aggregated model and systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal model based on simulation experiments. We show that the spatiotemporal model can recover spatial patterns in population and exploitation pressure as well as provide unbiased estimates of spatially aggregated population quantities. The spatiotemporal model also implicitly accounts for individual movement rates and can outperform spatially aggregated models by accounting for time-and-size varying selectivity caused by spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that spatiotemporal modelling framework is a feasible and promising approach to address the spatial structure of natural resource populations, which is a major challenge in understanding population dynamics and conducting resource assessments and management.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism’s aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental challenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstances where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endangered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmonids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.},

Previous studies have shown that female halibut in the warmer southern area mature at sizes 10–20 cm smaller than female halibut in the colder north. Our goal was to examine the role of growing degree-day (GDD, the number of days X temperature °C above a minimum threshold) on growth rate and length at maturity (LM50\%). Two separate datasets, associated with the stock-wide DFO-Industry Halibut Longline Survey, were used to estimate these life history traits. GDD had a significant effect on both growth rates and probability of maturity. Females grew faster and matured at a larger size than males. Female growth rate at a reference length of 90 cm corresponding to the southerly NAFO 4X was {\textasciitilde}11.5 cm/ year, significantly faster than in the northerly NAFO division 3N (8 cm/year). Male growth rate at 90 cm corresponding to NAFO divisions 4X and 4W were 7.2 and 7.5 cm/year, significantly faster than in NAFO divisions 3N and 3Ps (5.6 and 5.8 cm/year). Both sexes matured at smaller sizes in the southern areas with higher GDD. Females in the warmer southern divisions were more likely to mature {\textasciitilde}10–28cm less than the more northerly divisions. However, the corresponding prediction intervals for NAFO divisions were very wide. On average, fish mature at a smaller size in 4WX, but we cannot predict length at maturity for any new observations in any division. We have identified large variation in life history traits across the stock domain associated with the thermal regime. Such variation in life history traits could be used to improve the assessment models and may also be indicative of stock structure that could be eroded if not addressed in the management of the fishery.},

	abstract = {Abstract Four marine fish species are among the most important on the world market: cod, salmon, tuna, and sea bass. While the supply of North American and European markets for two of these species – Atlantic salmon and European sea bass – mainly comes from fish farming, Atlantic cod and tunas are mainly caught from wild stocks. We address the question what will be the status of these wild stocks in the midterm future, in the year 2048, to be specific. Whereas the effects of climate change and ecological driving forces on fish stocks have already gained much attention, our prime interest is in studying the effects of changing economic drivers, as well as the impact of variable management effectiveness. Using a process-based ecological–economic multispecies optimization model, we assess the future stock status under different scenarios of change. We simulate (i) technological progress in fishing, (ii) increasing demand for fish, and (iii) increasing supply of farmed fish, as well as the interplay of these driving forces under different scenarios of (limited) fishery management effectiveness. We find that economic change has a substantial effect on fish populations. Increasing aquaculture production can dampen the fishing pressure on wild stocks, but this effect is likely to be overwhelmed by increasing demand and technological progress, both increasing fishing pressure. The only solution to avoid collapse of the majority of stocks is institutional change to improve management effectiveness significantly above the current state. We conclude that full recognition of economic drivers of change will be needed to successfully develop an integrated ecosystem management and to sustain the wild fish stocks until 2048 and beyond.},

	abstract = {Discards of Atlantic cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder are estimated annually for the Canadian scallop fishery on Georges Bank. The offshore scallop fishery consists of two types of fishing vessels, wet fish (WF) vessels and freezer trawlers (FT). Gavaris et al. (2007) determined that the fishing efficiency between these two fleets differed and derived a conversion factor of 1.2 (±0.05; SE); where 1 FT hour = 1.2 (±0.05) WF hour. Discards have since been derived using effort in standardized freezer trawler hours and there is no adjustment for the number of dredges or size of dredges. However, the fishery statistics for all offshore scallop trips includes information on the number of dredges and gear width that can be used to compare between the current standardized freezer trawler effort approach (effort in hours (h)) and an approach using effort in hour×meters (hm). By applying a multiplicative main effects model to catch rate data from 2005 to 2011 for the offshore scallop fishery, a conversion factor of 1.26 (±0.05; SE), where 1 FT hour = 1.26 ± 0.05 WF hour, was determined for effort in hours which is consistent with Gavaris et al. (2007). However, fleet was not a significant factor when catch rates in kg•hm-1 were used and therefore no conversion factor in effort between wet fish and freezer trawler vessels is required when effort in hours×meters is used. It is recommended that hm be used as the measure of scallop fishing effort to calculate discards from the 2012 scallop fishery and for subsequent years.},

	abstract = {Substantial economic opportunities have been identified in many Australian fisheries but may remain unimplemented due to the perception that the role of government is to ensure harvests are biologically sustainable, while economic decisions should be left to the commercial industry. This paper explores the role of government in driving changes that increase revenue and profit from fisheries (termed economic benefit). Australian fisheries resources are managed by eight different jurisdictions. While each have separate legislation, there is invariably a responsibility to manage on behalf of, and to the benefit of the public, who are the owners of the resource. This paper uses case studies to explore how government can struggle to determine the public interest, separate this from private interests and then implement management changes to ensure the public utility is maximised. Common problems were: (i) overarching economic objectives, which define who should benefit, were often ambiguous and open to interpretation; (ii) the public interest was usually abstract and often under-represented in decision-making processes, (in contrast to industry, who have direct representation); (iii) special interest groups were often able to lobby against changes; and (iv) government was often reluctant to seize opportunities to increase economic benefit when there was significant industry opposition to management changes. In drawing attention to these challenges and how they have been overcome historically, it is argued that government has both a role and requirement under their legislative objectives to take the lead in implementing measures that increase the economic benefit from Australian fisheries.},

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have increasingly designated globally, with an associated advertised percentage of area protected. However, recent research has made it clear that many MPAs are not actually protecting marine biodiversity. Dureuil et al. focused on European MPAs and found that trawling, one of the most damaging types of fishing, occurs widely in these areas. Furthermore, using sharks and rays as indicator species, they found that many MPAs are failing to protect vulnerable species.
Science, this issue p. 1403
Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to conserve biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29\% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and conservation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59\% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected areas. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69\% in heavily trawled areas. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity conservation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected areas worldwide.
Marine protected areas need better definitions and protection from industrial fishing to serve as true protected areas.

Systematic reserve-selection tools allow simultaneous optimization for ecological objectives while minimizing costs but are seldom used to incorporate socioeconomic costs in the reserve-design process. The sensitivity of this process to biodiversity data resolution has been studied widely but the issue of socioeconomic data resolution has not previously been considered. We therefore designed marine reserves for biodiversity conservation with the constraint of minimizing commercial fishing revenue losses and investigated how economic data resolution affected the results. Incorporating coarse-resolution economic data from official statistics generated reserves that were only marginally less costly to the fishery than those designed with no attempt to minimize economic impacts. An intensive survey yielded fine-resolution data that, when incorporated in the design process, substantially reduced predicted fishery losses. Such an approach could help minimize fisher displacement because the least profitable grounds are selected for the reserve. Other work has shown that low-resolution biodiversity data can lead to underestimation of the conservation value of some sites, and a risk of overlooking the most valuable areas, and we have similarly shown that low-resolution economic data can cause underestimation of the profitability of some sites and a risk of inadvertently including these in the reserve. Detailed socioeconomic data are therefore an essential input for the design of cost-effective reserve networks.},

We considered consumptive and nonconsumptive interests of multiple stakeholders (i.e., fishers, scuba divers, conservationists, managers, scientists) in the systematic design of a network of marine protected areas along California's central coast in the context of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. With advice from managers, administrators, and scientists, a representative group of stakeholders defined biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic goals that accommodated social needs and conserved marine ecosystems, consistent with legal requirements. To satisfy biodiversity goals, we targeted 11 marine habitats across 5 depth zones, areas of high species diversity, and areas containing species of special status. We minimized adverse socioeconomic impacts by minimizing negative effects on fishers. We included fine-scale fishing data from the recreational and commercial fishing sectors across 24 fisheries. Protected areas designed with consideration of commercial and recreational fisheries reduced potential impact to the fisheries approximately 21\% more than protected areas designed without consideration of fishing effort and resulted in a small increase in the total area protected (approximately 3.4\%). We incorporated confidential fishing data without revealing the identity of specific fisheries or individual fishing grounds. We sited a portion of the protected areas near land parks, marine laboratories, and scientific monitoring sites to address nonconsumptive socioeconomic goals. Our results show that a stakeholder-driven design process can use systematic conservation-planning methods to successfully produce options for network design that satisfy multiple conservation and socioeconomic objectives. Marine protected areas that incorporate multiple stakeholder interests without compromising biodiversity conservation goals are more likely to protect marine ecosystems.},

However, despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in conservation success, little formal theory exists for how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off. Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably how equity influences probability of conservation success, in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives. Results here provide an important foundation for moving the science and practice of conservation planning—and broader spatial planning in general—toward more consistently achieving efficient, equitable, and effective outcomes.},

	abstract = {Seasonal closures are commonly used to reduce fishing mortality in recreational and commercial fisheries, but they may be less effective when effort is merely displaced to the open season or in multispecies fisheries that allow for discarding to continue while other species are targeted. The latter is especially true for the valuable multispecies recreational reef fish fishery in the Gulf of Mexico, where discard mortality is high and it can be difficult to avoid catching one species while fishing for others. We evaluated the utility of complete bottom fishing closures (in addition to already mandated harvest closures) that would temporarily prohibit recreational reef fishing as a means to control effort, reduce the amount of dead discards, and improve stock status of multiple species. In this study we developed age-structured population models for six Gulf of Mexico reef fish species that dominate the recreational catch, with each model linked to a monthly effort dynamic model for the recreational fishery. The effect of closing any given month(s) varied across species and resulted in tradeoffs, such that some closures may result in positive effects on biomass of one species and negative effects on others. For example, a spring closure was predicted to have positive effects on Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus spawning stock biomass but negative effects on Gag grouper Mycteroperca microlepis due to the contrasting patterns in harvest rates during those months. These tradeoffs were associated with seasonal availability patterns and the degree to which anglers might shift effort to the open season. The closure scenarios that were most likely to reduce dead discards without negatively impacting harvest, spawning biomass, or total effort occurred in late winter and early spring (March \& April). In evaluating seasonal fishing closures, the gains in biomass and reductions in dead discards must be weighed against the socio-economic tradeoffs, in terms of lost effort-generated revenue at various spatial and temporal scales and angler dissatisfaction.},

We argue that it is important to distinguish the range dynamics of such species from those that occur without, or with less clear, involvement of human-induced environmental changes. We elucidate the salient features of the rapid increase in the number of species whose range dynamics are human induced, and review the relationships and differences to both natural range expansion and biological invasions. We discuss the consequences for science, policy and management in an era of rapid global change and highlight four key challenges relating to basic gaps in knowledge, and the transfer of scientific understanding to biodiversity management and policy. We conclude that range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change will become an essential feature for biodiversity management and science in the Anthropocene. Finally, we propose the term neonative for these taxa.},

Using cross-correlations to assess the relationship between time-lagged pressure and state indicators: an exemplary analysis of North Sea fish population indicators. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 670–681.A sustainable ecosystem-based management, as postulated by the European Union-Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), requires a sound understanding of the cause–effect relationships between human pressures and ecosystem states. In this study, cross-correlations are used to introduce a protocol for the analysis of time-lagged relationships between pressure and state indicators. To perform meaningful cross-correlations, the time-series of the pressure and the state indicator should be prewhitened by fitting autoregressive integrated moving average models to the pressure indicator time-series. This study provides some theoretical examples on the implications of non-prewhitened and prewhitened cross-correlations and exemplifies the use of prewhitened cross-correlations to compare the pressure–state relationship of a well-established indicator suite vs. the relationship of a new indicator proposed under the MSFD. The established indicator suite is fishing mortality (F) vs. spawning-stock biomass (SSB), the new indicator suite is F vs. the 95\% percentile of the length frequency distribution (L95). The L95 aims to characterize the proportion of large individuals within a population. The prewhitened cross-correlations for F and SSB are significant for all four analysed species (cod, haddock, saithe, and plaice), the L95 is correlated with F for cod, haddock, and saithe. However, the L95 was also influenced by the annual survey catch and recruitment.},

	abstract = {By-catch is one of the most significant issues affecting fisheries management today. Incidental mortality of species which are long-lived and have low reproductive rates is a conservation problem affecting marine mammals, sea birds, sea turtles, sharks and other groups. By-catches can affect biodiversity through impacts on top predators, the removal of individuals from many species, or by elimination of prey. The by-catch issue is also one of waste; the millions of tons of protein dumped in the ocean, and the waste of animal lives is often condemned on moral grounds. For the economist, it generates additional costs without affecting the revenues, and may hinder profitability. For the fishers, it causes conflicts among fisheries, it gives fishers a bad public image, generates regulations and limitations on the use of resources, and frequently has negative effects on the resources harvested through the mortality of juvenile and undersized individuals of the target species before they reach their optimal size from the point of view of future yield. Several examples of major by-catch issues are described, focusing also on the solutions to the problems which have been developed by scientists, fisheries managers and members of the fishing industry itself. By-catch is an extremely complex set of scientific issues, not only an economic, political, or moral one. Although only a few fisheries include by-catches of the target species in their stock assessment (e.g. Pacific halibut), it is clear that by-catch management will be an integral part of most future ecosystem management schemes. These considerations, together with the introduction of environmental variability and a better handling of scientific uncertainty, should lead to more intelligent ways to harvest our resources.},

	abstract = {Empirical discard mortality rate estimates are vital to both stock assessments and ﬁshery management, especially for stocks that experience high discard rates, such as in the recreational rod-and-reel ﬁshery for Haddock Melanogrammus aegleﬁnus in the Gulf of Maine. The objective of the present study was to derive a ﬁshery-scale discard mortality rate estimate for Haddock that are captured and released in the Gulf of Maine recreational ﬁshery by combining results of an electronic-tagging telemetry experiment with representative ﬁshery-dependent survey data. Scientiﬁc personnel and industry partners collected data on a suite of biological, environmental, and technical covariates from 2,442 Haddock caught under authentic ﬁshery scenarios during 2015. Despite being a physoclistous species, {\textless}1\% of sampled Haddock were observed to die when brought onboard and only {\textasciitilde}3\% ﬂoated upon release. Postrelease fate was then monitored for 154 Haddock using passive acoustic telemetry and determined using a semiquantitative classiﬁcation procedure reliant upon movement data of Haddock with known fates. The resulting data were analyzed with a parametric survival model to identify which capture-related covariates inﬂuenced mortality. Fishing season and length-class of Haddock were the most signiﬁcant predictors of discard mortality, with increased mortality for smaller individuals caught during the autumn, possibly due to increased temperatures. Survival modeling identiﬁed that mortality from these covariates occurred primarily after release as compared with during capture and handling. By integrating survival modeling results with ﬁshery-dependent observations, a ﬁshery-scale discard mortality rate of 63\% was estimated for the 2015 ﬁshing year. Based on these ﬁndings, we recommend that ﬁshery managers implement measures to reduce recreational Haddock discards, especially of smaller Haddock during warmer months.},

	abstract = {Atlantic cod form spawning aggregations in locations and seasons that are persistent from year to year and individual ﬁsh have been shown to exhibit spawning site ﬁdelity and home to speciﬁc spawning grounds each season. In the Gulf of Maine, cod are known to have historically occupied a mosaic of spawning grounds but many of these spawning components have been extirpated, primarily through overﬁshing, with a near complete loss of spawning along mid-coast and eastern Maine. The remaining spawning aggregations in the western Gulf of Maine are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation owing to their proximity to shore, the predictability of their timing, the ﬁne-scales upon which they operate, and the high density of ﬁsh within each aggregation. Broad scale management actions that are currently being discussed may allow an increased harvest from these spawning aggregations. In this paper we describe the creation of three small-scale area closures that serve to eliminate the exploitation and disturbance of discrete spawning aggregations of Atlantic cod and prevent the potential extirpation of these spawning components. Each closure was unique in the circumstances that surrounded their creation, including differences in the amount of prior protection from commercial and recreational exploitation, the timing and duration of the closure, the size of the closure area, the management body that had authority to enact the closure, the amount of monitoring that has occurred, and the amount of spatial or temporal modiﬁcations that have occurred since enactment. We believe the case for spawning closures for Atlantic cod has already been made by several authors and the purpose of this paper is not to present new science, but rather to show the path that was followed to create these spawning closures within the complicated array of ﬁsheries management.},

	abstract = {Fishery resources (fish, invertebrates, marine mammals, and reptiles) of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ, 3200 nautical miles from the coast) are currently regulated under several pieces of key legislation enacted during the early 1970s. At that time fishery science was only beginning to appreciate the interactions among species and fisheries as being potential impediments to simultaneous realization of competitive management goals. Many of the important management problems currently faced in the EEZ are exacerbated by the incompatibility of regulations promulgated separately under these statutes, for what are ecologically- or technologically-related species. Reconciling the management of interacting species and fishermen will require an institutional framework for evaluating the multispecies/multifishery consequences of management decisions, and for articulating a clear set of compatible management goals for the various constituents. Traditional single-species biological reference points for fishery management must be reevaluated considering the effects of harvesting on ecosystem attributes such as stability, diversity, resistance, and resilience, and economic attributes including optimization. Currently, dynamic mechanisms underlying species and fishery interactions are poorly understood. The scientific basis of decision making will increasingly have to come from research emphasizing the dynamic relationships of interacting species as well as the biological, economic, and technological factors contributing to fishery interactions. Such studies cannot replace traditional single-species, single-fishery analyses, but must compliment and build upon them.},

This reduction is most likely to be achieved by focusing even greater attention on the technical, regulatory and social approaches that are currently practiced. With respect to the technical approaches, meta-analysis indicates that overall reductions in bycatch of between 25\% and 64\% could be achieved if global ﬁshing ﬂeets could match somewhere between the minimum and median performance of gear modiﬁcations used in experimental studies. If such beneﬁts are to be delivered, however, engaging ﬁshers more comprehensively in solving the problems will be essential. Further developing legislative and institutional arrangements will also assist. However, notwithstanding the potential gains that can be achieved, it must be recognized that careful analysis will often be required to ensure that a proposed measure will achieve the desired objective at an acceptable cost.},

	abstract = {The argument that sufficiently high fishing mortality (selective or not) can effect genetic change in fished populations has gained considerable traction since the late 1970s. The intervening decades have provided compelling experimental and model-based evidence that fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) can cause genetic changes in life history, behaviour and body shape, given sufficiently high trait heritability, selection intensity and time. Fisheries-induced evolution research has also identified or inferred negative implications to population recovery and sustainable yield, prompting calls for evolutionarily enlightened management to reduce the probability of FIE and mitigate its risks. Sufficient time has now elapsed to evaluate whether predicted negative consequences to recovery have been empirically realized. We find that many FIE-implicated populations have recovered rapidly to management-based targets following cessation of overfishing. We conclude that FIE is generally of minor importance to recovery when compared with overfishing, magnitude of depletion and natural mortality. By posing a series of questions and responses, we illustrate how science advice pertaining to human-induced evolution in fishes can be strengthened. We suggest that FIE research be refocused and its communication refined to: (a) better integrate FIE within existing stock-assessment modelling frameworks; (b) pose questions of greater relevance at the science:policy interface; and (c) concentrate research on questions pertaining to the subset of depleted populations for which the implications of FIE are likely to be magnified because of their synergistic interactions with other correlates of recovery and yield.},

	abstract = {Climate change and fishery impacts modify the spatial distribution of marine species. Understanding and predicting changes in distribution is important for adaptation by fishers and the management of fishery resources and biodiversity. However, identifying such trends is challenging given the variability inherent in trawl survey data. We apply a novel two-step approach to identify fish distribution trends from trawl surveys. First, species-specific average locations (mean latitude and longitude centre of gravity) and extent (effective area occupied) were estimated within a spatio-temporal delta modelling framework. The resulting time series and associated variance estimates were then passed to a multivariate Bayesian state-space model to estimate average trends over the study period. We applied this two-stage approach to three decades (1986–2016) of demersal trawl research survey data from the Agulhas Bank of South Africa to quantify distributional changes in 44 commonly caught fishes (chondrichthyans and teleosts). Across the entire assemblage, average trends showed a westward (alongshore) shift in location and a reduction in the extent of populations. At the species level, six taxa showed a location trend towards the west or south-west, and three shifted towards the east or north-east. The area occupied by species showed two taxa that had a decreasing trend in spatial extent and one species that was expanding. The mean westward and contracting trends of the assemblage were interpreted as likely signals of climate forcing, whereas the eastward shift of three species may be linked to fishing impacts. A lack of knowledge of subsurface oceanographic changes in the region challenges interpretation of the distribution changes and is identified as a research priority. We recommend additional research regarding causal drivers of distribution shifts, specifically to attribute observed changes to climate, fishing, and inter-annual environmental variability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Decreasing body size has been proposed as a universal response to increasing temperatures. The physiology behind the response is well established for ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments: as higher temperatures decrease the aerobic capacity, individuals with smaller body sizes have a reduced risk of oxygen deprivation. However, empirical evidence of this response at the scale of communities and ecosystems is lacking for marine fish species. Here, we show that over a 40-year period six of eight commercial fish species in the North Sea examined underwent concomitant reductions in asymptotic body size with the synchronous component of the total variability coinciding with a 1?2 °C increase in water temperature. Smaller body sizes decreased the yield-per-recruit of these stocks by an average of 23\%. Although it is not possible to ascribe these phenotypic changes unequivocally to temperature, four aspects support this interpretation: (i) the synchronous trend was detected across species varying in their life history and life style; (ii) the decrease coincided with the period of increasing temperature; (iii) the direction of the phenotypic change is consistent with physiological knowledge; and (iv) no cross-species synchrony was detected in other species-specific factors potentially impacting growth. Our findings support a recent model-derived prediction that fish size will shrink in response to climate-induced changes in temperature and oxygen. The smaller body sizes being projected for the future are already detectable in the North Sea.},

Practical efforts to operationalize climate-responsive design and management in the global network of marine protected areas (MPAs) are required to ensure long-term effectiveness for safeguarding marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we review progress in integrating climate change adaptation into MPA design and management and provide eight recommendations to expedite this process. Climate-smart management objectives should become the default for all protected areas, and made into an explicit international policy target. Furthermore, incentives to use more dynamic management tools would increase the climate change responsiveness of the MPA network as a whole. Given ongoing negotiations on international conservation targets, now is the ideal time to proactively reform management of the global seascape for the dynamic climate-biodiversity reality.

	abstract = {Despite evidence that mobile bottom fishing gear causes physical damage to habitat-forming organisms on the seafloor, likely indirectly affecting associated fishes, it is difficult to determine how conservation and management policies influence such effects because researchers do not typically systematically quantify the extent and intensity of gear-habitat interactions. Here, we estimated spatiotemporal trends in bottom trawling in areas containing biogenic habitat (sponges and corals) on the US west coast to evaluate the effect of spatial closures, catch shares, and vessel buybacks. We predicted highest probabilities of biogenic habitat occurrence in moderate to deep depths north of Cape Mendocino and off southern California, and highest gear-habitat interaction frequencies in moderate depths off Oregon and Washington. Temporal trends in total biogenic habitat contacts tracked changes in fishing effort, mostly declining between 2003 and 2014 (declines between start and end year ranged from 51-55\% across taxa). However, the predicted frequency of contacts per unit effort increased by 17-56\% across taxa from 2003-2009, coinciding with implementation of spatial closures, and our results indicate this was due to effort displacement and shifting spatial distribution of fishing. These relative interaction rates then declined by 10-34\% after implementation of catch shares. Thus, although spatial closures may protect habitat within protected areas, without complementary policies, spatial closures may increase gear-habitat interactions in adjacent areas due to changes in fisher behavior and fishing effort displacement.},

In the U.S., NOAA has adopted a policy statement and Road Map to guide the development and implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). NOAA’s EBFM policy supports addressing the ecosystem interconnections to help maintain resilient and productive ecosystems, even as they respond to climate, habitat, ecological, and social and economic changes. Managing natural marine resources while taking into account their interactions with their environment and our human interactions with our resources and environment requires the support of ecosystem science, modeling, and analysis. Implementing EBFM will require using existing mandates and approaches that fit regional management structures and cultures. The primary mandate for managing marine fisheries in the U.S. is the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Many tenets of the Act align well with the EBFM policy; however, incorporating ecosystem analysis and models into fisheries management processes has faced procedural challenges in many jurisdictions. In this paper, we review example cases where scientists have had success in using ecosystem analysis and modeling to inform management priorities, and identify practices that help bring new ecosystem science information into existing policy processes.},

	abstract = {Summary Spatial management is used extensively in natural resource management to address sustainability and biodiversity issues, for example through declaration of terrestrial National Parks and marine protected areas (MPAs). Spatial management is used also to optimize yields or protect key parts of the life cycle of species that are utilized (hunted, farmed or fished), for example through rotational harvesting. To evaluate the effectiveness of marine spatial closures with conflicting fisheries and conservation objectives, a series of marine fisheries closures are here analysed using an integrative modelling tool known as management strategy evaluation (MSE). This modelling framework combines a food web model of a tropical ecosystem fished by a prawn (shrimp) fishery that emulates the resource being managed, together with the present management system and risk-based tools of fishing the prawn species at maximum economic yield. A series of spatial closures are designed and tested with the aim of investigating trade-offs among biodiversity (MPA), benthic impacts, ecosystem function, key species at risk to fishing, economic and sustainability objectives. Synthesis and applications. This paper illustrates that existing tools often available in actively managed fisheries can be linked together into an effective management strategy evaluation framework. Spatial closures tended to succeed with respect to their specific design objective, but this benefit did not necessarily flow to other broad-scale objectives. This demonstrates that there is no single management tool which satisfies all objectives, and that a suite of management tools is needed.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: In 1987 a large area ({\textasciitilde}13700 km$^{\textrm{2}}$) associated with 2 offshore banks on the Scotian Shelf (Nova Scotia, Canada) was closed to commercial trawling for groundfish in order to protect the juvenile stages of haddock {\textless}i{\textgreater}Melanogrammus
aeglefinus{\textless}/i{\textgreater} from discarding. We assessed possible changes in the finfish community structure before and after the closure. Species abundance data collected annually since 1970 were subjected to multivariate analyses such as cluster analysis and a
randomization/permutation test. Finfish community composition was significantly different after the implementation of the closure, and several species contributed to the post-closure difference including herring \textit{Clupea harengus}, winter flounder
\textit{Pseudopleuronectes americanus} and redfish \textit{Sebastes }sp., which showed dramatic increases in abundance. Haddock was the dominant species throughout the entire period. These findings suggest that several members of the finfish community
benefited from the area closure. However, community structure in a reference area that has never been closed to fishing (Browns Bank) became more similar to the community structure in the closed area, contrary to our expectations. We provide support for
the hypothesis that the dynamics of the Browns Bank area finfish community are coupled to the closed area through spillover based on several lines of inquiry, including positive relationships between abundance and area occupied of the dominant species and
non-contemporaneous increases in species abundance between the closed area and the Browns Bank area with lags ranging from 1 to 3 yr. This study argues that establishment of fishery closures is likely to have positive benefits to the component species at
both local and regional scales; however, the time-scale for such changes appears to be relatively long in comparison to tropical systems.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The effects of human exploitation on macroecological patterns have received little attention, although such investigations may highlight unique spatial and temporal changes characteristic of species and assemblages subject to persistent
disturbance. In unexploited systems (mainly among temperate avifauna) positive relationships between local abundance and geographic distribution are prevalent for individual species through time (intraspecific pattern) and among species during fixed time
periods (interspecific pattern). We investigated intraspecific and interspecific relationships for 24 common marine fishes on the Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy, Canada, some of which have been commercially exploited for several decades. Based on
extensive fisheries-independent trawl survey data from 1970 to 2001, 16 of the 34 stocks, comprising 13 species, exhibited significant positive intraspecific relationships. Significant relationships were associated mainly with those stocks that
demonstrated significant temporal trends in both abundance and geographic distribution. The time-averaged (32 yr) interspecific relationship was positive and significant at the largest scale examined. Significant annual interspecific relationships were
also detected over 26 yr. Surprisingly, the slopes of the annual relationships increased systematically and doubled through time, probably due to size-selective exploitation, shifting target species, and associated species interactions. In contrast to
previous studies, our results indicate that the contributions of individual species to the interspecific relationship can change through time, and these changes dramatically alter the interspecific abundance-distribution relationship. Temporal trends in
the interspecific relationship have not previously been reported, and appear to be due to the large spatial- and temporal-scale effects of exploitation.},

	abstract = {A juvenile haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) closed area was established on the offshore banks (Emerald and Western) of the central Scotian Shelf (NAFO Div. 4W) in 1987. The management objective associated with this meausre was to protect incoming recruits and thereby allow the stock to rebuild. Our evaluation of the effectiveness of the closed area revealed that the management objective was not fully met. The expected trend of declining juvenile mortality after, and high mortality preceding its imposition, was not readily apparent. The lack of response may have been due to several factors: (i) the proportion of juveniles within the closed area steadily declined and a majority of year classes during the post-closure period remained unprotected; (ii) the closed area remained open to fishing by fixed gear whose catches inside the closed area and surrounding areas steadily increased; and (iii) the resident haddock stock deteriorated in terms of growth and condition due to a combination of historical over-exploitation and large-scale environmental changes. The closed area does appear to have had some benefit to other groundfish species in terms of increased abundance, notably American plaice (Hippoglossoides americanus) and winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus).},

In some places, closed areas have been used for fisheries management for centuries [1] and, until recently, natural refugia also existed, inaccessible through depth, distance or adverse conditions. Developments in technology have left few areas of fishing interest beyond our reach. Recently, the idea of marine reserves as fisheries management tools has re-emerged with developing interest in ecosystem-based management, and observations of incidental fisheries benefits from reserves established for conservation. In light of new evidence, we argue that, by integrating large-scale networks of marine reserves into fishery management, we could reverse global fishery declines and provide urgently needed protection for marine species and their habitats.},

In the past, reserves have been created with little understanding of how they actually affect the areas they are intended to protect. A few recent reviews have evaluated how reserves in general affect the density and biomass of organisms within them, but little work has been done to assess temporal patterns of these impacts. Here we review 112 independent measurements of 80 reserves to show that the higher average values of density, biomass, average organism size, and diversity inside reserves (relative to controls) reach mean levels within a short (1?3?y) period of time and that the values are subsequently consistent across reserves of all ages (up to 40?y). Therefore, biological responses inside marine reserves appear to develop quickly and last through time. This result should facilitate their use in the management of marine resources.},

	abstract = {Georges Bank is one of the world’s most productive marine ecosystems, but the lack of accurate broad-scale sediment maps presently limits habitat assessments and spatial fisheries management. From 1999 to 2009 we surveyed 36,669km2 of Georges Bank using 2.8 and 0.6m2 quadrats viewed with live underwater video (video quadrats). The sediment types observed in 61,604 quadrats were used to map and evaluate spatial structure of local surficial sediment coarseness, dominance, heterogeneity, and maximum size characteristics at a 1km2 spatial resolution. Sand dominated sediment covered 62\% of the study area, and there was a logarithmic decline in coverage by larger, coarser and more heterogeneous sediments. Gravel dominated sediments covered 38\% of the study area and were more than twice as abundant as previously estimated. A 12,890km2 swath of gravel dominated seabed stretched from Cape Cod to northeastern Georges Bank consistent with estimates of prehistoric glacial extent. Within the swath there were 14 large gravel outcrops (15–2743km2) . This work increases the spatial resolution of sediment information available for habitat assessments and spatial fisheries management on Georges Bank by two orders of magnitude. The four sediment characteristics we evaluated support further detailed investigations of the Bank’s benthos, including the influences of surficial sediment characteristics on species and community distributions, and more spatially accurate estimates of seabed roughness. Finally, this work demonstrates the use of video quadrats as an alternative to traditional grab sampling and modern acoustic sampling for continental shelf-scale mapping.},

The effects of protection on the fish assemblages of the sublittoral rocky reefs in the “Penisola del Sinis-Isola di Mal di Ventre” MPA (W. Sardinia, Italy) were evaluated using a multi-year series of data. Four surveys, conducted 7, 10, 13 and 15 years after the area was designated as an MPA and carried out in the period spanning June and July, were used to estimate the abundance and biomass of commercial species. The surveys were carried out in zones with decreasing levels of fishing restrictions within the MPA (zones A, B, C) and in unprotected zones (OUT1 and OUT2), and underwater video visual census techniques were used. Protected zones only occasionally showed higher levels of abundance or biomass, and the trajectories of those metrics were not consistent across the years. In addition, the zone with the highest level of protection (zone A) never presented levels of abundance and biomass higher than those in zones B and C. This study shows that even 15 years after designation, protection has had no appreciable effect in the MPA studied. It is argued that this is emblematic of several shortcomings in the planning, regulation and enforcement frameworks of the MPA.},

	abstract = {Abstract The delineation of essential fish habitat is an important element of contemporary fisheries management. Although local-scale species?habitat relationships have been established for some managed species, we lack an understanding of these associations at the synoptic spatial scales on which fish populations and their associated fisheries operate. Interest in habitat delineations has been elevated further by an increased awareness of ongoing habitat degradation caused by mobile fishing gears and by the advancement of spatial management tools. Here we examine the associations between surficial sediment grain size and groundfish distributions in the Gulf of Maine?Georges Bank region. The mean abundances for 58 demersal fish species were determined for a spatial cell grid (185.2 km2 per cell), which was subsequently joined to a spatially referenced sediment database in a geographical information systems environment. Multivariate statistical methods were then used to examine how fish distribution and abundance varied with substrate grain size. Of the 58 species examined, 12 were consistently associated with particular substrate types. Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, longhorn sculpin Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus, sea raven Hemitripterus americanus, and winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus were consistently abundant in large-grained substrate types, whereas white hake Urophycis tenuis, goosefish Lophius americanus, red hake U. chuss, silver hake Merluccius bilinearis, witch flounder Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, and American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides were consistently abundant in fine-grained substrates. Little skate Leucoraja erinacea was most abundant in sediments of intermediate grain size. Although broadly distributed, spring dogfish Squalus acanthias consistently distinguished assemblages in fine-grained sediments. Given that we were able to detect even weak associations and that these relationships were consistent with local-scale studies, we recommend using these relationships to further refine essential fish habitat and that they be given more weight in this and similar temperate ecosystems.},

	abstract = {While fishery closures during the spawning season are commonplace, direct evidence for their benefit is mainly restricted to species forming large spawning aggregations. This paper analyses the conditions under which spawning closures could contribute to sustainable fisheries management by reviewing how fishing during spawning may affect the physiology, behaviour and ecology of individuals and how this may influence the dynamics and the genetics of the population. We distinguish between the effects of fishing activities in relation to mortality, disturbance of spawning activity, and impact on spawning habitat. Spawning closures may be of benefit it they: (1) reduce the fishing mortality of the large and older spawners; (2) avoid negative effects on spawning habitats; (3) reduce the risk of over-exploitation in species which form large spawning aggregations; (4) reduce the evolutionary effects on maturation and reproductive investment; and (5) reduce the risk of over-exploitation of specific spawning components. The contribution of spawning closures to sustainable fisheries will differ among species and depends on the complexity of the spawning system, the level of aggregation during spawning and the vulnerability of the spawning habitat. The importance of these closures depends on the degree of population depletion but does not cease when populations are ‘healthy’ (i.e. no sign that recruitment is impaired).},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Large-harvested populations initially produced the highest catch but quickly evolved a lower yield than controls. Small-harvested populations did the reverse. These shifts were caused by selection of genotypes with slower or faster rates of growth. Management tools that preserve natural genetic variation are necessary for long-term sustainable yield.},

Studying futures is not only a crucial element of the interaction between science, management and decision making, but also a critical research challenge per se, especially because futures cannot be observed or experimented on. In addition, researchers can encounter methodological and theoretical difficulties, which make interpretations and predictions problematic. In the literature which deals with futures of ecological systems two main lines of research can be distinguished: a predictive approach, which dominates the literature, can be contrasted with a rarer number of studies that elaborate potential scenarios for ecological systems. Scenario approaches currently concern mainly contacts with stakeholders or decision makers, or the use of climate scenarios to derive projections about ecological futures. We argue that a new direction for ecological futures research could be explored by using ecological scenarios in combination with predictive models to further fundamental ecological research, in addition to enhancing its applied value.},

Answering this fundamental question for any species requires an understanding of the relationship between offspring size and offspring fitness. A major goal of evolutionary ecologists has been to estimate this critical relationship, but for organisms with complex lifecycles, logistical constraints restrict most studies to early life-history stages only. Here, we examine the relationship between offspring size and offspring performance in the field across multiple life-history stages and across generations in a marine invertebrate .We then use these data to parameterise a simple optimality model to generate predictions of optimal offspring size and determined whether these predictions depended on which estimate of offspring performance was used. We found that offspring size had consistently positive effects on performance (estimated as post-metamorphic growth, fecundity and reproductive output). We also found that manipulating the experience of offspring during the larval phase changed the way in which offspring size affects performance: offspring size affected post-metamorphic growth when larvae were allowed to settle immediately but offspring size affected survival when larvae were forced to swim prior to settlement. Despite finding consistently positive effects of offspring size, early measures of the effect of offspring size resulted in the systematic underestimation of optimal offspring size. Surprisingly, the amount of variation in offspring performance that offspring size explained decreased with increasing time in the field but the steepness of the relationship between offspring size and performance actually increased. Our results suggest caution should be exercised when empirically examining offspring size effects - it may not be appropriate to assume that early measures are a good reflection of the actual relationship between offspring size and fitness.},

For marine species, early life history stages are inherently vulnerable to predators and an innate ability to detect predators can be critical for survival. However, whether or not acidification inhibits predator detection is unknown. Here, we show that newly hatched larvae of the marine fish Amphiprion percula innately detect predators using olfactory cues and this ability is retained through to settlement. Aquarium-reared larvae, not previously exposed to predators, were able to distinguish between the olfactory cues of predatory and non-predatory species. However, when eggs and larvae were exposed to seawater simulating ocean acidification (pH 7.8 and 1000 p. p. m. CO2) settlement-stage larvae became strongly attracted to the smell of predators and the ability to discriminate between predators and non-predators was lost. Newly hatched larvae were unaffected by CO2 exposure and were still able to distinguish between predatory and non-predatory fish. If this impairment of olfactory preferences in settlement-stage larvae translates to higher mortality as a result of increased predation risk, there could be direct consequences for the replenishment and the sustainability of marine populations.},

	abstract = {The area burned in the North American boreal forest is controlled by the frequency of mid-tropospheric blocking highs that cause rapid fuel drying. Climate controls the area burned through changing the dynamics of large-scale teleconnection patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation/El Nino Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation, PDO/ENSO and AO) that control the frequency of blocking highs over the continent at different time scales. Changes in these teleconnections may be caused by the current global warming. Thus, an increase in temperature alone need not be associated with an increase in area burned in the North American boreal forest. Since the end of the Little Ice Age, the climate has been unusually moist and variable: large fire years have occurred in unusual years, fire frequency has decreased and fire-climate relationships have occurred at interannual to decadal time scales. Prolonged and severe droughts were common in the past and were partly associated with changes in the PDO/ENSO system. Under these conditions, large fire years become common, fire frequency increases and fire-climate relationships occur at decadal to centennial time scales. A suggested return to the drier climate regimes of the past would imply major changes in the temporal dynamics of fire-climate relationships and in area burned, a reduction in the mean age of the forest, and changes in species composition of the North American boreal forest.},

	abstract = {Patterns in marine fish biodiversity can be assessed by quantifying temporal variation in rate of population change, abundance, life history and demography concomitant with long-term reductions in abundance. Based on data for 177 populations (62 species) from four north-temperate oceanic regions (Northeast Atlantic and Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, North mid-Atlantic), 81{\textbackslash}\% of the populations in decline prior to 1992 experienced reductions in their rate of loss thereafter; species whose rate of population decline accelerated after 1992 were predominantly top predators such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), sole (Solea solea) and pelagic sharks. Combining population data across regions and species, marine fish have declined 35{\textbackslash}\% since 1978 and are currently less than 70{\textbackslash}\% of recorded maxima; demersal species are generally at historic lows, pelagic species are generally stable or increasing in abundance. Declines by demersal species have been associated with substantive increases in pelagic species, a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that increases in the latter may be attributable to reduced predation mortality. There is a need to determine the consequences to population growth effected by the reductions in age (21{\textbackslash}\%) and size (13{\textbackslash}\%) at maturity and in mean age (5{\textbackslash}\%) and size (18{\textbackslash}\%) of spawners, concomitant with population decline. We conclude that reductions in the rate of population decline, in the absence of targets for population increase, will be insufficient to effect a recovery of marine fish biodiversity, and that great care must be exercised when interpreting multi-species patterns in abundance. Of fundamental importance is the need to explain the geographical, species-specific and habitat biases that pervade patterns of marine fish recovery and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {We address the hypothesis that survival of a cohort is directly related to growth rates during the pre-recruit period for marine fish. This hypothesis is widely accepted, but supporting field evidence has been elusive. Here the connection between size and year-class strength at the early stages is examined for the commercially important Barents Sea stocks of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and herring (Clupea harengus). We show that there is a close link between length and year-class strength at the 0-group stage within and among the populations studied, and that the connection also holds between length at the 0-group stage and strength of recruitment at age 3. Both length and abundance are closely related to temperature. Interannual variability in the temperature conditions is concluded to be the underlying cause of the covariability between growth and year-class strength. We hypothesize that for stocks at the high latitude end of the overall range of the species the environmental signal tends to over-ride density-dependent effects on growth. High temperature will cause a high production of prey items leading to higher growth rates and higher survival through the vulnerable larval and juvenile stages. The duration of the high-mortality and vulnerable stages is also decreased by higher temperature directly increasing the development rate.

Available evidence suggests that the NAO influences ecological dynamics in both marine and terrestrial systems, and its effects may be seen in variation at the individual, population and community levels. The ecological responses to the NAO encompass changes in timing of reproduction, population dynamics, abundance, spatial distribution and interspecific relationships such as competition and predator-prey relationships. This indicates that local responses to large-scale changes may be more subtle than previously suggested. We propose that the NAO effects may be classified as three types: direct, indirect and integrated. Such a classification will help the design and interpretation of analyses attempting to relate ecological changes to the NAO and, possibly, to climate in general.},

We also formulate a method for modeling the fishing mortality on the oldest ages of the fish caught. Estimates are obtained using maximum likelihood. We conclude that the level of correlation among ages is sufficiently large to produce large biases in the standard methods for some stocks. The statistical model that includes correlated errors greatly reduces bias and increases efficiency if the correlation in the estimation error is large.},

These ecosystems support a rate of fish harvest nearly 100 times the global mean and account for {\textgreater}20{\textbackslash}\% of the world's marine fish catch. Environmental variability is thought to be the major cause of the decadal-scale biomass fluctuations characteristic of fish populations in these regions, but the mechanisms relating atmospheric physics to fish production remain unexplained. Two atmospheric conditions induce different types of, upwelling in these ecosystems: coastal, alongshore wind stress, resulting in rapid upwelling (with high vertical velocity, w); and wind-stress curl, resulting in slower upwelling (low w). We show that the level of wind-stress curl has increased and that production of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) varies with wind-stress curl over the past six decades. The extent of isopycnal shoaling, nutricline depth, and chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean also correlate positively with wind-stress curl. The size structure of plankton assemblages is related to the rate of wind-forced upwelling, and sardine feed efficiently on small plankters generated by slow upwelling. Upwelling rate is a fundamental determinant of the biological structure and production in coastal pelagic ecosystems, and future changes in the magnitude and spatial gradient of wind stress may have important and differing effects on these ecosystems. Understanding of the biological mechanisms relating fisheries production to environmental variability is essential for wise management of marine resources under a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were used as a model in an artificial fertilization experiment to investigate the relationships between individual adult O. nerka and their offspring. Survival, size and burst swimming ability were assessed in fry of known parentage (adult spawners from the Weaver Creek population, British Columbia, Canada). Maternal identity significantly affected the survival rate of eggs at hatch time, though this effect did not extend to fry life stages. The results were also suggestive of a paternal effect on both egg and fry survival, though this could not be separated from the experimental block design. After 4 months of exogenous feeding, fry mass remained under significant maternal influence, though fork length did not, despite having a high correlation with mass. Burst swimming performance was highly variable among individuals, and was not significantly influenced by maternal identity or individual fry size. Collectively, the findings presented here suggest that maternal, and possibly paternal, effects can be integral components of population dynamics in the early life stages of O. nerka. A good understanding of these factors will be essential for scientists and fisheries managers in developing a more holistic view of population-level spawning success and fry survival.},

	abstract = {We review interactions between extrinsic threats to marine fishes and intrinsic aspects of their biology that determine how populations and species respond to those threats. Information is available on the status of less than 5{\textbackslash}\% of the world's approximately 15 500 marine fish species, most of which are of commercial importance. By 2001, based on data from 98 North Atlantic and northeast Pacific populations, marine fishes had declined by a median 65{\textbackslash}\% in breeding biomass from known historic levels; 28 populations had declined by more than 80{\textbackslash}\%. Most of these declines would be sufficient to warrant a status of threatened with extinction under international threat criteria. However, this interpretation is highly controversial, in part because of a perception that marine fishes have a suite of life history characteristics, including high fecundity and large geographical ranges, which might confer greater resilience than that shown by terrestrial vertebrates. We review 15 comparative analyses that have tested for these and other life history correlates of vulnerability in marine fishes. The empirical evidence suggests that large body size and late maturity are the best predictors of vulnerability to fishing, regardless of whether differences among taxa in fishing mortality are controlled; there is no evidence that high fecundity confers increased resilience. The evidence reviewed here is of direct relevance to the diverse criteria used at global and national levels by various bodies to assess threat status of fishes. Simple life history traits can be incorporated directly into quantitative assessment criteria, or used to modify the conclusions of quantitative assessments, or used as preliminary screening criteria for assessment of the similar to 95{\textbackslash}\% of marine fish species whose status has yet to be evaluated either by conservationists or fisheries scientists.},

	abstract = {1. Plant demographers using matrix tools have paid special attention to vital rates of reproduction, growth and survival. The demographic implications of plants regressing in size, or shrinking, have been overlooked. Shrinkage has either been ignored during demographic censuses or lumped with other demographic processes such as stasis or growth under the assumption that they have similar demographic effects. 2. We carried out a comparative prospective analysis using classical vital rate elasticities in size-based projection matrices of 80 herbaceous perennial species. We analysed the correlations of the elasticities of each demographic vital rate with the demographic life-history traits (life span, population growth rate, etc.). 3. We also conducted a comparative loop analysis to understand the effects of shrinkage on demographic parameters linked to size plasticity. We classified loops into `recruitment' (growth that contributes to reproduction), `size plasticity' (where individuals fluctuate in size) and `size rigidity' (no change in size class), and used them as the basis to explain ecological characteristics of the species. 4. Our results with classical vital rates demonstrate that considering shrinkage as a separate vital rate increases our understanding of factors that contribute to demographic equilibrium (e.g. minimized departure from population growth rate at equilibrium) and buffering (e.g. higher speed of recovery after disturbance), and to reproductive strategies (e.g. mean age of parents of offspring). 5. The loop analysis results support the findings with vital rate analyses and also reveal new patterns: high growth rates are not exclusively dominated by high elasticities of recruitment, but also by size-plastic loops, and long-lived species experience a marginal increase in the demographic importance of size plasticity. 6. Synthesis. This study illustrates the necessity for exploring individual demographic vital rates, as opposed to grouping them, to advance our understanding of how different biological processes affect population dynamics. Shrinkage is demographically important because it aids in demographic buffering, increases survival and is related to maintenance-reproduction trade-offs. However, shrinkage cannot be fully explored only with traditional elasticity approaches; because shrinkage for some species is a fundamental plastic trait, its importance is more appropriately captured with loop analyses.},

Projection matrices have become the dominant modelling approach in plant demography because they (i) are relatively easy to formulate, (ii) compile complex data in a structured and analytically tractable manner, (iii) provide numerous parameters with direct biological meaning, (iv) allow the investigator to address broad or specific, experimental and/or theoretical, ecological and evolutionary questions, and (v) produce uniform outputs, enabling direct comparisons between the results of different studies. 2. The last decade has witnessed major advancements in this field that have brought demographic models much closer to the real world, in particular in the analysis of effects of spatial and temporal environmental variation on populations. The present Special Feature contributes to that progress with novel methodologies and applications on Integral Projection Models, stochastic Life Table Response Experiment analyses, stochastic elasticities, transient dynamics and phylogenetic analyses. 3.Synthesis. Environmental stochasticity is an integral part of ecosystems, and plant populations exhibit a tremendous array of demographic strategies to deal with its effects. The analytical challenge of understanding how populations avoid, tolerate or depend on stochasticity is finally overcome with the new matrix approaches. The tools are now available to interpret the effects of changes in temporal and spatial variation on plant populations.},

	abstract = {Because of competitive interactions in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tissue and bodily requirements for each of the three dietary essential fatty acids in marine fish, 22:6n - 3, 20:5n - 3 and 20:4n - 6, cannot be meaningfully considered in isolation. Rather, it is necessary to consider requirements in relative as well as absolute amounts, i.e., in terms of the ratio of 22:6n - 3:20:5n - 3:20:4n - 6. This is illustrated by recent research in our laboratories which has suggested that the optimal dietary ratio of 22:6n - 3:20:5n - 3 in sea bass larvae is circa 2.1 with the optimal dietary ratio of 20:5n - 3:20:4n - 6 being circa 1:1. The optimal dietary ratio of 22:6n - 3:20:5n - 3 in turbot and halibut larvae is similarly circa 2:1 but the optimal dietary ratio of 20:5n - 3:20:4n - 6 in these species is 10:1 or greater. In addition, studies with salmon parr point to dietary 18:3n - 3 and 18:2n - 6 being important in determining the optimal tissue ratio of 20:5n - 3:20:4n - 6 for successful parr-smelt transition. We deduce that differences in essential fatty acid requirements for different species of fish reflect different dietary and metabolic adaptations to different habitats and consider how such knowledge can be exploited to develop improved diets for fish, especially in their early stages of development.

	abstract = {Variations in growth and condition of female fish change the viability pattern of the offspring. The influence of maternal effects on the reproductive potential, and hence recruitment, has gained support during the last decade, both from laboratory experiments and field investigations. Since such maternal effects are phenotypic and therefore the result of the age/size and condition composition of the spawning population, overfishing will cause the population to move away from its fitness peak. For this reason maternal effects are the only recruitment mechanism which can be directly managed through fishing regulations. This paper reviews the maternal effect of early larval survivorship in the field, in connection with the synchrony idea of J. Hjort and D. Cushing. The weak relation between spawning biomass and recruitment has discredited spawner abundance as a significant predictor of recruitment. Dynamic investigations on the maternal factors and the fecundity can be used to adjust estimates of spawning biomass. It is expected that this approach will clarify the significance of the spawning population in determining the level of recruitment.},

Is selection on body size and arrival timing, and opportunities for selection, related to indicators of breeding competition (breeding density and sex ratio)? Methods: Our data set consisted of genetic, phenotypic, and demographic data taken from adults of a small wild population of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We measured the lifetime reproductive success of adults by matching breeding adult offspring to their parents using genetic data and exclusion-based parentage assignment. We calculated the opportunity for selection and estimated selection coefficients using regression analysis. Results: Selection more often favoured large males and females than small ones, although the strength of selection operating on body size varied among years. Selection on arrival date varied widely in shape, direction, and strength among years. Male-biased sex ratios and greater male breeding density increased the opportunity for selection on males. Higher female breeding density increased the opportunity for selection on females. Sex ratio and breeding density were unrelated to the strength or direction of selection on male or female body size and arrival timing. Selection always favoured large male body size in years when the sex ratio was male biased, but varied greatly in direction among years when the sex ratio was female biased.},

These models are special cases of stage-structured population models. We show that stage-structured models generate dynamic heterogeneity: life-history differences produced by stochastic stratum dynamics. We characterize dynamic heterogeneity in a range of species across taxa by properties of the Markov chain: the entropy, which describes the extent of heterogeneity, and the subdominant eigenvalue, which describes the persistence of reproductive success during the life of an individual. Trajectories of reproductive stage determine survivorship, and we analyse the variance in lifespan within and between trajectories of reproductive stage. We show how stage-structured models can be used to predict realized distributions of lifetime reproductive success. Dynamic heterogeneity contrasts with fixed heterogeneity: unobserved differences that generate variation between life histories. We show by an example that observed distributions of lifetime reproductive success are often consistent with the claim that little or no fixed heterogeneity influences this trait. We propose that dynamic heterogeneity provides a `neutral' model for assessing the possible role of unobserved `quality' differences between individuals. We discuss fitness for dynamic life histories, and the implications of dynamic heterogeneity for the evolution of life histories and senescence.},

In Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, maturation begins in the egg soon after fertilisation and continues intermittently until the individual is capable of spawning. Completion of the process depends on exceeding genetically determined biochemical thresholds (lipid status) in critical seasons (through responsiveness to photoperiod cues). Hence, maturation is regulated by inhibition, and age and size at maturity depend on physiological efficiency (genetic endowment) and developmental opportunity (environmental context). This interaction of genetic diversity and developmental flexibility leads to multiple maturation trajectories (up to 32 in steelhead trout Oncorhychus mykiss) and wide variation in age and size at spawning. Severe depletion of a Kamchatka sockeye salmon Oncorhychus nerka population through 50 yr of oceanic fishing resulted in increasing proportions maturing rapidly at small size before emigration from freshwater. In the absence of such a fishery, genetic evidence suggests that stabilising selection would ultimately restore the anadromous, slower-maturing pattern as the predominant life style to such a stock.},

However, these techniques have received little notice from fisheries biologists, despite the widespread applicability to fisheries research, the wide variety of tag types used in fisheries research (from traditional fin clips to telemetry tags), and the development of new computer software to assist with analyses. We present a brief review of population models based on recaptures, returns, or telemetry relocations of tagged fish that can be used to estimate population size, total mortality, and components of mortality (i.e., fishing and natural) that are frequently of interest to fisheries biologists. Recommended strategies include (1) use closed population models (e.g., Lincoln-Peterson) to estimate population size for short term studies where closure assumption can be met, (2) use the robust design to estimate population size for studies of longer duration, (3) use high-reward tags in conjunction with other methods of estimating reporting rate in tag-return studies, (4) combine a subset of telemetry tagged fish with either a high-reward tagging program or a traditional capture-recapture study to improve mortality estimates and understanding of mortality components, and (5) use pilot studies and simulation analyses to assess precision of estimated parameters to evaluate study feasibility. Incorporation of these improved techniques could lead to greater accuracy and precision of parameter estimates from tagging studies and thus to improved understanding and management of fish populations.},

Two groups of each taxon were acclimated at 20°C in a recirculating-water system housed in an environmental chamber and were fed either a natural or prepared diet for 84 d. The fatty acid composition of the natural diet was 13\% more unsaturated than that of the prepared diet. Fish fed the natural diet subsequently had unsaturated: Saturated fatty acid ratios 10-25\% higher than fish fed the prepared diet. After being subjected to identical simulated cold fronts (10°C drop in surface water temperature, as if the fish were confined in cages or pens), all groups of fish fed the prepared diet suffered high mortality (50-90\%) whereas there was zero mortality among the groups receiving the natural diet. White bass and sunshine bass fed the prepared diet had higher survival rates (50\% and 40\%, respectively) compared with their striped bass and palmetto bass counterparts (10\% and 20\%, respectively). The lower incipient lethal temperature was higher for fish fed the prepared diet (5.9, 4.8, 2.5, and 1.9°C for striped bass, palmetto bass, sunshine bass and white bass, respectively) than for those fed the natural diet (near 0.0°C, but 1.8°C for sunshine bass). Both studies reflect a maternal affect on cold tolerance, with white bass being most tolerant. We demonstrated that diet-induced muscle fatty acid composition directly affects cold tolerance of striped bass, white bass, and their hybrids.},

In nature, thermal gradients provide habitat structure to which fish orient. Apparently, fish have evolved to fit into ‘thermal niches’ to optimize physiological, ecological, and reproductive performance in their native habitats. However, man has perturbed many of these habitats to the point where previously advantageous thermal preference behavior may now be inappropriate. Thermal perturbations are the most obviously related examples of man's interference, but a fish's inherent thermal preference behavior can also magnify the biological effects of changes in dissolved oxygen, food supply, toxicants, and physical barriers. Environmental management should (1) consider thermal preference behavior when evaluating habitat suitability, (2) manage for needed temperature and thermal structure, and (3) give priority attention to minimizing degradation of preferred thermal habitat, especially when it is in short supply.},

For this comparative study, we use the 50- year larval fish time series from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, which allows us to view fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Our results indicate that exploited species show a clearer distributional shift in response to environmental change than unexploited species, even after accounting for life history and ecological traits and phylogeny. The enhanced response (improved signal- noise ratio) to environmental change in exploited species may be a consequence of reduced spatial heterogeneity caused by fishery- induced age (size) truncation and the constriction of geographic distribution that accompanies fishing pressure. We suggest that reduced spatial heterogeneity can cause exploited populations to be more vulnerable to climate variability, an effect that could have considerable importance in the management of fish stocks. This is the first study to compare the geographic distributions of a large suite of exploited and unexploited fish species from the northeastern Pacific in response to climate variability.},

	abstract = {Based on an analysis of 90 marine fish populations, collapses (the greatest proportional reduction in spawner biomass over 15 years) are predicated typically by dramatic increases in fishing mortality and recoveries are more likely to occur when exploitation is reduced. However among populations for which fishing mortality declined after collapse recovery was independent of exploitation rate, even when fishing mortality (F) post-collapse was expressed as a function of each population's maximum growth rate (r). After a period of 15 years, many populations that experienced 15 year declines {\textgreater}60{\textbackslash}\% exhibited little or no recovery, despite considerable reductions in fishing mortality. This suggests that factors other than fishing may be considerably more important to recovery, and fishing less important, than previously thought. Furthermore. among populations for which fishing mortality decreased post-collapse, rate of population decline was a reliable predictor of recovery. With the possible exception of clupeids, variation in marine fish breeding population size was found to differ little from that of other vertebrates, and such variability appears to have no effect on rate of recovery. In addition to providing an empirical framework for the study of population collapse and recovery, the analyses presented here provide a means of assessing the precautionary nature of various population-decline thresholds used to assign extinction risks to marine fish.

In this paper, we demonstrate how source-sink and habitat selection theory can provide guidance for harvesting spatially structured populations. We also show how harvesting can affect the spatial distribution of the exploited resource, which has consequences for the design of protected areas. This implicit treatment of space is complemented by a spatially explicit predator-prey model. It turns out that harvesting of the prey and/or the predator species in one patch in space sometimes has effects on the other species outside the harvested patch. We stress the importance of considering how realistic the representation of the spatial dimension has to be in population management.},

	abstract = {1. Despite a large literature documenting the effects of mutualists and/or antagonists on plant performance, we still have limited insight into the strength of these interactions, as this involves quantifying how one species influences the population dynamics of another. 2. Here, we use data from two example systems, Cynoglossum officinale and Calathea ovandensis, to illustrate how experiments, demographic data and stage-based population models can be combined to estimate interaction strength of insect herbivores on plants. Because many plant populations may not be at equilibrium, we conduct transient analyses and contrast these results to more traditional asymptotic results. 3. We calculate three metrics of interaction strength, Delta lambda(asymptotic), the change in asymptotic annual per capita plant population growth rate resulting from herbivore exclusion, Delta lambda(t), the change in transient lambda caused by herbivores at t = M (where M = the time of their maximum effect during the transient phase) and Delta lambda(transient), a time-averaged effect of consumers on lambda across the entire transient phase. 4. Fairly strong impacts of insect consumers on plant fecundity do not translate similarly to Delta lambda(asymptotic). Results show that Delta lambda(t) can be larger (or smaller) than Delta lambda(asymptotic) but in our examples Delta lambda(transient) was similar in magnitude to Delta lambda(asymptotic). 5. The transient effects of consumers on lambda were driven by changes in the elasticity of fecundity across the transient phase. These effects were dynamic even though consumer impacts on demography and vital rates were held constant. The importance of particular stages and transitions to annual population growth vary during the transient phase. 6.Synthesis. We describe three metrics of interaction strength, Delta lambda(asymptotic), Delta lambda(t) and Delta lambda(transient). These metrics have several advantages over more commonly used trait or performance measures that quantify the outcome of interactions. We illustrate how the transient impacts of consumers on lambda are dynamic, with the changing stage distribution of a population and transient elasticities driving these effects. More generally, this study shows that the impacts of animals on plant performance do not translate equivalently to plant population growth, thereby underscoring the importance of using population models to extend the inference of individual-level experiments.},

The combination of current environmental conditions, fishing mortality rates, and stock size indicates that this fishery is not sustainable. In order to rebuild the population and sustain the fishery in the future, it is essential to define a biologically appropriate exploitation level. In this paper, we take a decision-theoretical approach and use risk analysis to compare different management actions in terms of fishing mortality rates, and predict stock size in a short, medium and long-term perspective. We consider alternative hypotheses about the stock biomass in 1999 and analyse the risk of stock decline below three thresholds: quasi-extinction (B-ext, defined by us), the safe biological limit, and the precautionary. approach limit as defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Results show that the current fishing mortality implies a tremendous risk of driving the Baltic cod stock below B-ext (1000 t) within 10 yr. This result is robust to alternative assumptions about model structure as well as to the magnitude of environmental stochasticity. Hence, we consider a substantial reduction of the fishing mortality to be the only way of avoiding the far-reaching ecological and socio-economic consequences of continued exploitation at current levels.},

A reconstruction of underlying ecological processes can only be done if we are certain of either the demographic or the noise model, which is something that can only be achieved by an improved theory of stochastic ecological processes.

The very warm conditions in the northeastern Pacific Ocean since 1976 seem similar to conditions experienced from about 1850 to 1870 Coastal pelagic fish abundances since 1930 indicate an orderly sequence of four or five dominant species through these cycles that is very similar to the order and timing of fluctuations in catches of similar pelagic fishes in Japanese waters. The consistency and predictability of this rotation and the biological relationship to low-frequency fluctuations in physical conditions are important areas for further research.

This relationship is improved by including the age composition of the spawning stock. Spawning stock age diversity in each year from 1955 to 1992 was estimated with the Shannon index using the number of mature fish in each age group. By including information on age composition, 31{\textbackslash}\% of the total variation in recruitment was accounted for by the model with stock size, age diversity, and the interaction between the two, compared with less than 15{\textbackslash}\% by single factor models of either age diversity or stock size.

The validity of this assumption is in question for long-lived gadoid stocks; however, estimating total egg production independently of spawner biomass is seldom feasible. An alternative approach is to examine correlations between recruitment and variables likely to be proxies for total egg production by the stock. This indirect approach was used for haddock on the Scotian Shelf. Indices of growth (mean length at age-4) and condition (weight at 50 cm) were used as proxies for the reproductive potential of individual spawners. Both variables were positively correlated with recruitment over a 3-decade period (1964-1995). During the same time period, there was no relationship between recruitment and spawner biomass estimated by Virtual Population Analysis (VPA). This is further evidence that VPA-based spawner biomass is a poor index of the true reproductive potential of the stock.

	volume = {335},
	issn = {0171-8630},
	abstract = {In exploited fish stocks, long-term trends towards earlier maturation have been interpreted as an evolutionary response to sustained, high fishing mortality. The evidence used to support this diagnosis consists of directional shifts in probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) that are consistent with the expectation that high fishing mortality favours the genotype for early maturation. Most PMRNs describe the probability of becoming mature solely as a function of age and length. Because they do not fully account for several physiological aspects of maturation (including growth effects on maturation, critical time windows for maturation decisions and developmental thresholds for maturation), it is possible that the observed shifts in PMRNs that are currently being attributed to changes in genotype actually reflect environmental effects on maturation. In this study, a comparative approach was used to interrogate the historical database for Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua in relation to 2 contrasting but not mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) that there is a significant effect of food availability on the probability of being mature, using condition as a proxy for food availability; and (2) that there has been a long-term shift in the PMRN for maturation in a direction that is consistent with a diagnosis of fisheries-induced evolution. The results show that the maturation trends in Northeast Arctic cod could be variously interpreted as showing a strong environmental effect, no genetic effect, or a strong genetic effect. If the scope of the analysis had been restricted to testing a single hypothesis related to either an environmental effect or a genetic effect, then the study could very easily have made a Type I error of inference. A more integrated view of maturation, incorporating key aspects of the physiological processes that culminate in maturation, is therefore required to avoid incorrect inferences about the underlying causes of earlier maturation.},

Providing management advice proceeds by transforming estimates of biological variables such as B,, and K into management variables such as the maximum sustainable yield (C*) and the fishing mortality rate that would achieve this yield (F*). There is no analytical solution for the transformation of B-o, kappa to C*, or F* for age-structured models with commonly used stock-recruitment functions and therefore must be done numerically. The opposite transition, however, does have an analytical solution for both the Beverton-Holt and Ricker recruitment models with partial selectivities for all age classes. Use of these analytical solutions allows for age-structured assessment models to be directly parameterized in terms of the management variables C* and F*.

	abstract = {To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging(1-3). A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated(4-6) is the possibility that the pattern of variability - its strength as a function of population size - may be more than `noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density- dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities(7). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction(8-10).},

	abstract = {We present a new methodology to estimate rates of energy acquisition, maintenance, reproductive investment and the onset of maturation (four-trait estimation) by fitting an energy allocation model to individual growth trajectories. The accuracy and precision of the method is evaluated on simulated growth trajectories. In the deterministic case, all life history parameters are well estimated with negligible bias over realistic parameter ranges. Adding environmental variability reduces precision, causes the maintenance and reproductive investment to be confounded with a negative error correlation, and tends, if strong, to result in an underestimation of the energy acquisition and maintenance and an overestimation of the age and size at the onset of maturation. Assuming a priori incorrect allometric scaling exponents also leads to a general but fairly predictable bias. To avoid confounding in applications we propose to assume a constant maintenance (three-trait estimation), which can be obtained by fitting reproductive investment simultaneously to size at age on population data. The results become qualitatively more robust but the improvement of the estimate of the onset of maturation is not significant. When applied to growth curves back-calculated from otoliths of female North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa, the four-trait and three-trait estimation produced estimates for the onset of maturation very similar to those obtained by direct observation. The correlations between life-history traits match expectations. We discuss the potential of the methodology in studies of the ecology and evolution of life history parameters in wild populations.},

Both fisheries-induced evolution and environmentally-induced phenotypic plasticity could contribute to the changing age and size at maturity of Pacific salmon. We evaluated the potential for genetic changes in the maturation schedule of Japanese chum salmon using the probabilistic maturation reaction norm (PMRN) method. We found that the recent decrease in size at maturity, and increase in age at maturity, of Japanese chum salmon can be largely attributed to a phenotypic response to a reduced growth rate, but that fisheries-induced evolution should not be ruled out. Recent claims concerning fisheries-induced evolution of the maturation schedule are based on the decline in the age-specific body size at which the probability of maturing is 50{\textbackslash}\%, a feature of PMRNs. However, the PMRN could change with changing environmental conditions. Therefore, a genetic change cannot be diagnosed only by the PMRN method.},

So far, three main bet-hedging strategies have been described: conservative bet-hedging (play it safe), diversified bet-hedging (donâ€™t put all eggs in one basket) and adaptive coin flipping (choose a strategy at random from a fixed distribution). Within this context, we analyse the trade-off between many small eggs (or seeds) and few large, given an unpredictable environment. Our model is an extension of previous models and allows for any combination of the bet-hedging strategies mentioned above. In our individual-based model (accounting for both ecological and evolutionary forces), the optimal bet-hedging strategy is a combination of conservative and diversified bet-hedging and adaptive coin flipping, which means a variation in egg size both within clutches and between years. Hence, we show how phenotypic variation within a population, often assumed to be due to non-adaptive variation, instead can be the result of females having this mixed strategy. Our results provide a new perspective on bet-hedging and stress the importance of extreme events in life history evolution.},

However, larvae from young spawners can experience higher mortality rates than larvae of older spawners, reducing the effect of egg production by young females (hereafter, maternal age effects). This reduction leads to an error in LEP that can be accounted for by reducing the fishing mortality rate, but raises the question of the magnitude of these errors if they are present but not accounted for. Calculations using parameters from a typical long-lived fish demonstrated that maternal age effects resulted in large errors in estimates of lifetime reproduction when there was a large contrast in the larval mortality rate extending over the reproductive life span. Errors were small when maternal age effects reduced the reproductive potential of only the very youngest spawners, at ages when a small fraction of females are mature. A specific example using the empirically derived maternal age effect for black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) indicated that errors in traditional management would be small for this species.},

Harvesting mature individuals displaces the reaction norm for age and size at maturation toward older ages and larger sizes and rotates it clockwise, whereas harvesting immature individuals has the reverse qualitative effect. If both immature and mature individuals are harvested, the net effect has approximately the same trend as when harvesting immature individuals only. This stems from the sensitivity of the evolutionary response, which depends on the maturity state of harvested individuals, but also on the type of harvest mortality (negatively or positively density dependent, density independent) and the value of three life-history parameters (natural mortality, growth rate and the trade-off between growth and reproduction). Evolutionary changes in the maturation reaction norm have strong repercussions for the mean size and the density of harvested individuals that, in most cases, result in the reduction of biomass-a response that population dynamical models would overlook. These results highlight the importance of accounting for evolutionary trends in the long-term management of exploited living resources and give qualitative insights into how to minimize the detrimental consequences of harvest-induced evolutionary changes in maturation reaction norms.},

	url = {10.1007/s10144-009-0146-4},
	abstract = {In this paper, we review mate-finding Allee effects from ecological and evolutionary points of view. We define `mate-finding' as mate searching in mobile animals, and also as the meeting of gametes for sessile animals and plants (pollination). We consider related issues such as mate quality and choice, sperm limitation and physiological stimulation of reproduction by conspecifics, as well as discussing the role of demographic stochasticity in generating mate-finding Allee effects. We consider the role of component Allee effects due to mate-finding in generating demographic Allee effects (at the population level). Compelling evidence for demographic Allee effects due to mate-finding (as well as via other mechanisms) is still limited, due to difficulties in censusing rare populations or a failure to identify underlying mechanisms, but also because of fitness trade-offs, population spatial structure and metapopulation dynamics, and because the strength of component Allee effects may vary in time and space. Mate-finding Allee effects act on individual fitness and are thus susceptible to change via natural selection. We believe it is useful to distinguish two routes by which evolution can act to mitigate mate-finding Allee effects. The first is evolution of characteristics such as calls, pheromones, hermaphroditism, etc. which make mate-finding more efficient at low density, thus eliminating the Allee effect. Such adaptations are very abundant in the natural world, and may have arisen to avoid Allee effects, although other hypotheses are also possible. The second route is to avoid low density via adaptations such as permanent or periodic aggregation. In this case, the Allee effect is still present, but its effects are avoided. These two strategies may have different consequences in a world where many populations are being artificially reduced to low density: in the first case, population growth rate can be maintained, while in the second case, the mechanism to avoid Allee effects has been destroyed. It is therefore in these latter populations that we predict the greatest evidence for mate-finding Allee effects and associated demographic consequences. This idea is supported by the existing empirical evidence for demographic Allee effects. Given a strong effect that mate-finding appears to have on individual fitness, we support the continuing quest to find connections between component mate-finding Allee effects (individual reproductive fitness) and the demographic consequences. There are many reasons why such studies are difficult, but it is important, particularly given the increasing number of populations and species of conservation concern, that the ecological community understands more about how widespread demographic Allee effects really are, and why.},

We here examine adaptive changes in lifeâ€history traits and survival rates for wild guppies introduced into new environments. Female lifeâ€history traits in the derived (Damier River) populations diverged from the ancestral (Yarra River) population, as a result of adaptation to predation regime (high vs. low) and other aspects of the local river. Moreover, some components of the derived Damier populations, particularly juveniles, now show higher survival in the Damier than do contemporary representatives from the ancestral Yarra population. These results suggest that adaptive change can improve survival rates after fewer than 10 years (fewer than 30 guppy generations) in a new environment.},

We decompose short-term elasticity as a sum of (i) the effect of the perturbation in rates on the unperturbed population structure and (ii) the effect of the original vital rates on the difference in structure between the original and the perturbed population. We provide exact analytical formulas for these components. In a population at its stable stage distribution (SSD), short-term elasticity is determined mainly by the SSD and reproductive value. In a non-stable population, short-term elasticity depends also on the projection of initial structure on the SSD, equal to population momentum. Non-stable stage structures matter most to elasticity if stages are missing that take time to fill in. We show how the demographic damping rate of the original population determines the rate at which short-term elasticity converges to its limiting values.},

	title = {Effect of dietary lipids on macrophage function, stress susceptibility and disease esistance in {Atlantic} salmon ({Salmo} salar)},
	volume = {30},
	abstract = {As the supply of marine fish oil is becoming a limiting factor in the production of Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar), new diets and alternative sources of energy are being tested. Plant oils are natural potential candidates to replace fish oil, but the different levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids may influence the health and growth of salmon. In this study, we have investigated the resistance to transport stress and bacterial infection, phagocytic activity in head kidney macrophages and eicosanoid metabolism in salmon fed three different diets. In high-energy fishmeal based diets, 50{\textbackslash}\% and 100{\textbackslash}\% of the supplementary fish oil (FO) was replaced with soybean oil ( SO). The three dietary groups were fed for 950 day-degrees at 5 degrees C ( 27 weeks) and 12 degrees C ( 11 weeks) before challenging the fish with Aeromonas salmonicida, analyzing the lipid composition of head kidney and examining macrophage function in vivo and in vitro. Dietary fatty acids affected the lipid composition of the kidney. The level of eicosanoid precursor's 20: 4n-6 and 20: 3n-6 were 3 and 7-fold higher in the 100{\textbackslash}\% SO group compared with the FO group. The total fraction of n-3 lipids in kidney was 19{\textbackslash}\% in the SO group, compared to 16{\textbackslash}\% and 12{\textbackslash}\% in the 50{\textbackslash}\% or 100{\textbackslash}\% SO groups, respectively. However, the production of leucotriene B-4 (LTB) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE) immunoreactive materiel from exogenously added arachidonic acid in head kidney macrophages was only affected by the composite diet ( increased) at 5 degrees C. In addition, the phagocytic activity of kidney macrophages in vivo and in vitro was not affected by diet. No effect of diet was observed on transport stress or susceptibility to a bacterial infection with Aeromonas salmonicida. Atlantic salmon therefore seems to tolerate a diet solely based on soybean oil as lipid source, without any detrimental effects on growth, health and immune functions.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {We investigated environmental effects on larval anchovy fluctuations (based on CPUE from 1980 to 2000) in the waters off southwestern Taiwan using advanced time series analyses, including the state-space approach to remove seasonality, wavelet analysis to investigate transient relationships, and stationary bootstrap to test correlation between time series. For large-scale environmental effects, we used the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to represent the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO); for local hydrographic conditions, we used sea surface temperature (SST), river runoff, and mixing conditions. Whereas the anchovy catch consisted of a northern species (Engraulis japonicus) and two southern species (Encrasicholina heteroloba and Encrasicholina punctifer), the magnitude of the anchovy catch appeared to be mainly determined by the strength of Eng. japonicus (Japanese anchovy). The main factor that caused the interannual variation of anchovy CPUE might change through time. The CPUE showed a negative correlation with combination of water temperature and river runoff before 1987 and a positive correlation with river runoff after 1988. Whereas a significant negative correlation between CPUE and ENSOs existed, this correlation was driven completely by the low-frequency ENSO events and explained only 10{\textbackslash}\% of the variance. Several previous studies on this population emphasized that the fluctuations of larval anchovy abundance were determined by local SST. Our analyses indicated that such a correlation was transient and simply reflected ENSO signals. Recent advances in physical oceanography around Taiwan showed that the ENSOs reduced the strength of the Asian monsoon and thus weakened the China Coastal Current toward Taiwan. The decline of larval anchovy during ENSO may be due to reduced China Coastal Current, which is important in facilitating the spawning migration of the Japanese anchovy.},

	abstract = {We examined the role of salinity, body size, and energetic state in determining low temperature tolerance of young-of-the-year (YOY) striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and used this information to map optimal overwintering habitat in the Hudson River estuary. A long-term experiment compared survival at 15 ppt and 30 ppt. In additional experiments, winter-acclimated fish were exposed to temperature declines (2.3°C·day1 to 1°C·week1) at salinities from 0 ppt to 35 ppt. Highest survival at low temperatures was consistently observed at intermediate salinities. These results suggest that the observed distribution of overwintering striped bass is related to physiological constraints on osmo regulatory ability at low temperatures. Low temperature tolerance appeared unrelated to body size and energetic state. Salinity profiles were used to describe the location and extent of optimal wintering habitats under various hydrographic regimes. The location of optimal habitats was displaced by over 27 km along the river a..., L'examen des rôles de la salinité, de la taille et du statut énergétique sur la tolérance à la température chez de jeunes bars rayés (Morone saxatilis) de l'année (YOY) a servi à cartographier l'habitat optimal d'hiver dans l'estuaire de la Hudson. Une expérience de longue durée a comparé la survie à 15 et à 30 ppt. Au cours d'expériences subséquentes, des poissons acclimatés à l'hiver ont été exposés à des déclins de température (2,3oC·jour1 à 1oC·semaine1) à des salinités variant de 0 à 35 ppt. La survie maximale aux basses températures s'observe toujours aux salinités intermédiaires. Ces résultats laissent croire que la répartition des bars rayés observée pendant l'hiver dépend de contraintes physiologiques sur la capacité osmorégulatrice à basse température. La tolérance aux basses températures apparaît être sans relation avec la taille ou le statut énergétique. Des profils de salinité permettent de décrire l'emplacement et l'étendue des habitats optimaux d'hiver sous divers régimes hydrographiques....},

	abstract = {Physiological responses to acclimation temperature and confinement stress were studied in yearling striped bass, Morone saxatilis. Temperature significantly affected plasma cortisol, glucose, chloride, and hematocrit but not osmolality in fish acclimated to 5, 10, 16, 21, 25 and 30°C. Close confinement for 12 min in a net resulted in changes of these characteristics in some or all of these groups. Generally, plasma cortisol and glucose increased, and plasma chloride, osmolality, and hematocrit decreased due to net confinement, and returned toward resting levels after release from the net. The physiological changes during stress were greatest and the recovery from these changes was slowest at 5 and 30°C. Further, the quantitative response was least and the recovery most rapid in fish stressed at 10 and 16°C. Acclimating and moving striped bass within this temperature range should decrease stress-related responses and mortality and thus improve yield after stocking.},

In a split-plot experiment, growth and feeding rates were compared between anadromous (Chesapeake Bay) and nonanadromous (Santee-Cooper) broods of juvenile striped bass (45-90 days posthatch) exposed to a range of salinity levels (0.5, 7, and 15 ppt) and temperatures (20, 24, and 28 C). At 28 C, which best simulated the summertime conditions of young juveniles, Chesapeake Bay fish showed highest growth performance. For this temperature and strain, growth was approximately 40\% higher at 7 ppt than at 0.5 or 15 ppt. Santee-Cooper juveniles showed no response to salinity. Over combined temperature and salinity levels, Chesapeake Bay juveniles experienced 22\% higher growth rates than did Santee-Cooper juveniles, supporting a proposal that early growth rates are inversely related to latitude. Because salinity had a strong effect on Chesapeake Bay striped bass growth rate, we also conclude that variation in distribution patterns within and among estuaries can substantially modify the expected latitudinal gradient in growth rate.},

	abstract = {To aid recovery efforts of smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) populations in U.S. waters a research project was developed to assess how changes in environmental conditions within estuarine areas affected the presence, movements, and activity space of this endangered species. Forty juvenile P. pectinata were fitted with acoustic tags and monitored within the lower 27 km of the Caloosahatchee River estuary, Florida, between 2005 and 2007. Sawfish were monitored within the study site from 1 to 473 days, and the number of consecutive days present ranged from 1 to 125. Residency index values for individuals varied considerably, with annual means highest in 2005 (0.95) and lowest in 2007 (0.73) when several P. pectinata moved upriver beyond detection range during drier conditions. Mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centers of activity was typically {\textless}0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 psu, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range. Thus, freshwater flow from Lake Okeechobee (and its effect on salinity) affects the location of individuals within the estuary, although it remains unclear whether or not these movements are threatening recovery.},

	abstract = {Most larger individuals of migratory striped bass Morone saxatilis from the two major Atlantic coast stocks, the Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River, appear to winter in mid-Atlantic coastal waters. But it is not known whether they exhibit differential wintertime distributions in accordance with the latitudinal differences in locations of these two estuaries. Mixed-stock analyses were conducted based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA genotypic frequencies on wintertime collections of striped bass from coastal waters. No significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) were seen in the proportions of striped bass from the two stocks between collections made from the Delaware Bay mouth and Cape Hatteras in 1997. However, there was a substantially higher Hudson contribution to a 1995 collection from coastal New Jersey (0.349, SD = 0.136) than to the combined 1997 Delaware Bay mouth and Cape Hatteras collection (0.157, SD = 0.072), suggesting this question deserves further study. Additionally, use of the original four reference samples from Chesapeake Bay tributaries (Choptank, Potomac, Rappahannock, Upper Bay) proved adequate alone in characterizing the Chesapeake Bay stock in simulations in which additional tributary collections (Nanticoke, Patuxent, Pocomoke) were added.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of pollock (the synonymous European common name is saithe) pre-spawning aggregations were described at two locations with contrasting bathymetric features on the Scotian Shelf, off the Canadian Maritimes. The data were collected using a split-beam echosounder onboard a research vessel, augmented with periodic, bottom-trawl samples. Pollock form aggregations each fall that persist at the same location over time. Such aggregations appeared to be associated with spawning. Hydroacoustic information indicates that pollock become more densely aggregated at night. This could reflect movement away from the study area during the day, or changes in the proportion of pollock in the acoustic dead zone over the 24-h period. The hydroacoustic information indicates that while pollock can occur up to 30 m off bottom, the greatest proportion remains within 1–5 m off bottom during both day and night. The length composition of the pollock aggregations differed between the two sites, with larger fish found at the site further offshore. Within an aggregation, there was spatial heterogeneity with respect to fish size, with larger fish found primarily within the core area of aggregation as shown by the hydroacoustics. An appropriate survey design for obtaining an index of abundance for pollock would reflect both the contagious (patchy) distribution as they prepare to spawn, and the diel differences in the availability of the fish to the hydroacoustic-sampling gear.},

	abstract = {1. When range shifts or invasions of plant species are studied, it is important to know whether large-scale spatial variation in a species' demography can be ignored or approximated by variation observed over smaller spatial scales. 2. Here, we studied the population dynamics of three similar (as shown by elasticity analysis) short-lived perennial plant species in multiple sites in different European countries over 2 years. We constructed a total of 40 transition matrices and analysed the spatio-temporal variation in the projected population growth rate (lambda) with spatially nested life table response experiments (LTRE). 3. All species (Carlina vulgaris, Tragopogon pratensis and Hypochaeris radicata) showed considerable life-history variation among regions on top of variation among sites within regions. 4. Net variance contributions (NVC), a novel LTRE statistic, revealed that in each species, variation in one group of vital rates contributed most to variation in lambda among regions as well as among sites. However, that most important type of vital rates differed between species: plant growth in C. vulgaris, flower head production in T. pratensis and establishment probability of seedlings in H. radicata. The rankings of the NVCs of other vital rates varied between site and region effects, suggesting that buffering through negative vital rate correlations varies over different spatial scales, while the identity of the main contributor to lambda variation is more constant. 5. Temporal effects were smaller than spatial effects, but the LTREs showed strong interactions between time and space (region or site), suggesting that the effect of, e.g. climate fluctuations are not synchronized throughout the distribution of a species. 6. Synthesis. This study shows that the life histories of plant species are distinguishable even when mean elasticity values show only small differences, and that life histories vary over the distribution range of a species. Demographic differences over large spatial scales can therefore only be partly substituted by small scale spatial variation in modelling studies on the population dynamics of a species across its entire distribution.},

	abstract = {The present paper reviews the effects of water temperature and flow on migrations, embryonic development, hatching, emergence, growth and life-history traits in light of the ongoing climate change with emphasis on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. The expected climate change in the Atlantic is for milder and wetter winters, with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, decrease in ice-covered periods and frequent periods with extreme weather. Overall, thermal limits for salmonids are species specific. Scope for activity and growth and optimal temperature for growth increase with temperature to an optimal point before constrain by the oxygen content of the water. The optimal temperature for growth decreases with increasing fish size and varies little among populations within species, whereas the growth efficiency may be locally adapted to the temperature conditions of the home stream during the growth season. Indirectly, temperature influences age and size at smolting through its effect on growth. Time of spawning, egg hatching and emergence of the larvae vary with temperature and selective effects on time of first feeding. Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality. Future research challenges are summarized at the end of the paper. (C) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles},

	abstract = {We have constructed an ``expert-knowledge classification system'' to categorize 309 fish taxa in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ichthyoplankton database into primary (coastal, coastal-oceanic, and oceanic) assemblages based on their principal ecological domains and subsequently, secondary assemblages according to the habitat affinities of adults. We examined effects of fishing, climate, adult habitat, and age-at-maturation on long-term variation of fish populations. We tested the hypothesis that populations of unexploited taxa, track climatic trends more closely than those of exploited taxa insofar as climatic signals may be confounded by fishing effects. Most oceanic taxa (23/34) showed a significant relationship with environmental variables and followed the trend of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Very few coastal (3/10) and coastal-oceanic (3/23) taxa exhibited a significant relationship with environmental signals; however, several fluctuated coherently, and age-at-maturation is an important factor. The lack of close correlation between fish populations and environmental signals in the coastal and coastal-oceanic assemblages indicates that these species might show nonlinear biological responses to external forcing rather than a simple linear tracking of environmental variables. We did not find a systematic pattern indicating that fishing influenced population fluctuation of exploited species. Constrained comparisons of exploited to unexploited species living in the same habitat and reaching maturity at the same age revealed evidence of overexploitation for some species but not for all. Our results suggest that considering life history and ecological characteristics of fish species and applying a community approach are important in understanding fishing effects on fish populations in the context of a changing environment.

Contemporary perception is that marine fishes may be less vulnerable to extinction than other taxa, because of great natural variability in abundance, high fecundity, rapid population growth, and an intrinsically high capability of recovering from low population size. Contrary to perception, however, there appears to be generally little theoretical or empirical support for the hypotheses that marine fish are more likely to experience large reductions in population size, to produce unusually high levels of recruitment, to have higher reproductive rates, or to recover more rapidly from prolonged population declines than nonmarine fishes. Although existing population-decline criteria may not accurately reflect probabilities of biological extinction, they do appear to reflect the converse-population recovery. Insufficient support for contemporary perceptions of their susceptibility to extinction, coupled with caveats associated with the assignment of extinction risk, suggest that significant increases in the population-decline thresholds used to assign marine fishes to at-risk categories would be inconsistent with a precautionary approach to fisheries management and the conservation of marine biodiversity.},

	abstract = {We investigate how model populations respond to stochastic harvesting in a stochastic environment. In particular, we show that the effects of variable harvesting on the variance in population density and yield depend critically on the autocorrelation of environmental noise and on whether the endogenous dynamics of the population display over- or undercompensation to density. These factors interact in complicated ways; harvesting shifts the slope of the renewal function, and the net effect of this shift will depend on the sign and magnitude of the other influences. For example, when environmental noise exhibits a positive auto correlation, the relative importance of a variable harvest to the variance in density increases with overcompensation but decreases with undercompensation. For a fixed harvesting level, an increasing level of autocorrelation in environmental noise will decrease the relative variation in population density when overcompensation would otherwise occur. These and other intricate interactions have important ramifications for the interpretation of time series data when no prior knowledge of demographic or environmental details exists, These effects are important whenever the harvesting rate is sufficiently high or variable, conditions likely to occur in many systems, whether the harvesting is caused by commercial exploitation or by any other strong agent of density-independent mortality.},

	abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is r, the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r is substantially positive.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) define the probability that individuals mature as a function of age and size. PMRNs have recently been used to derive empirical support for the hypothesis that high fishing mortality has induced genetic change towards earlier maturation in exploited populations. However, the 2-dimensional PMRN method does not, strictly speaking, disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic change in maturation. Instead, it disentangles the contribution of variation in growth and mortality from other sources of variation contributing to changes in maturation. After removing the contribution of variation in growth and mortality, any remaining change is not necessarily purely genetic. Environmental factors may exist that directly affect the propensity to mature at a certain size and age. An observed trend in the size-age PMRN may therefore be partly or fully explained by a co-incidental trend in an (environmental) factor. As pointed out by Grift et al. (2007; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 334:213-224), such co-dependence is captured conceptually by multi-dimensional PMRNs, as opposed to 2-dimensional (size-age) PMRNs, where the higher dimensions represent the relevant variables. Dimensions that may partly or fully explain the observed trends in size-age PMRNs, other than evolution, include temperature, polluting endocrine -disrupting chemicals, the social structure of the population, and body condition; changes in the last two may be fisheries-induced. To illustrate these views, I re-analysed data on North Sea plaice, and demonstrated that temperature explains part of the shift in the size-age PMRN but that a residual shift remains. The latter finding supports the hypothesis of genetic change.},

	abstract = {Allee effects are an important dynamic phenomenon believed to be manifested in several population processes, notably extinction and invasion. Though widely cited in these contexts, the evidence for their strength and prevalence has not been critically evaluated. We review results from 91 studies on Allee effects in natural animal populations. We focus on empirical signatures that are used or might be used to detect Allee effects, the types of data in which Allee effects are evident, the empirical support for the occurrence of critical densities in natural populations, and differences among taxa both in the presence of Allee effects and primary causal mechanisms. We find that conclusive examples are known from Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Chordata, including three classes of vertebrates, and are most commonly documented to result from mate limitation in invertebrates and from predator-prey interactions in vertebrates. More than half of studies failed to distinguish component and demographic Allee effects in data, although the distinction is crucial to most of the population-level dynamic implications associated with Allee effects (e.g., the existence of an unstable critical density associated with strong Allee effects). Thus, although we find conclusive evidence for Allee effects due to a variety of mechanisms in natural populations of 59 animal species, we also find that existing data addressing the strength and commonness of Allee effects across species and populations is limited; evidence for a critical density for most populations is lacking. We suggest that current studies, mainly observational in nature, should be supplemented by population-scale experiments and approaches connecting component and demographic effects.},

From 1970 to 1995, the length of juvenile (age-l) haddock on the SWSS was negatively correlated with the abundance of adults (age-4+). Within year-classes temporal trends in juvenile length persisted through to the adult stage such that year-classes that were small(large) at age-1 were small(large) at age-3. These two results were combined with the positive correlation observed between recruitment and the body size characteristics of haddock on the SWSS in a conceptual model of compensatory recruitment regulation. In the model high adult abundance decreases growth of juveniles leading to smaller-sized adults and subsequently lower recruitment. Conversely, low adult abundance results in increased growth of juveniles leading to larger adults and higher recruitment. Density-dependent growth of juveniles, combined with the positive correlation between recruitment and adult body size, constitutes a compensatory mechanism for adjusting future haddock recruitment according to present adult abundance.},

	abstract = {The connectivity of marine populations is often surprisingly lower than predicted by the dispersal capabilities of propagules alone. Estimates of connectivity, moreover, do not always scale with distance and are sometimes counterintuitive. Population connectivity requires more than just the simple exchange of settlers among populations: it also requires the successful establishment and reproduction of exogenous colonizers. Marine organisms often disperse over large spatial scales, encountering very different environments and suffering extremely high levels of post-colonization mortality. Given the growing evidence that such selection pressures often vary over spatial scales that are much smaller than those of dispersal, we argue that selection will bias survival against exogenous colonizers. We call this selection against exogenous colonizers a phenotype-environment mismatch and argue that phenotype-environment mismatches represent an important barrier to connectivity in the sea. Crucially, these mismatches may operate independently of distance and thereby have the potential to explain the counterintuitive patterns of connectivity often seen in marine environments. We discuss how such mismatches might alter our understanding and management of marine populations. Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 128-140.},

Shorter experiments and less severe reductions in fishing rate lead to high probabilities of poor choices for postexperimental fishing rate, while much longer experiments do not produce Substantially more information yet forego opportunities for higher harvests.},

	abstract = {Extinction risk in natural populations depends on stochastic factors that affect individuals, and is estimated by incorporating such factors into stochastic models(1-9). Stochasticity can be divided into four categories, which include the probabilistic nature of birth and death at the level of individuals ( demographic stochasticity(2)), variation in population- level birth and death rates among times or locations ( environmental stochasticity(1,3)), the sex of individuals(6,8) and variation in vital rates among individuals within a population ( demographic heterogeneity(7,9)). Mechanistic stochastic models that include all of these factors have not previously been developed to examine their combined effects on extinction risk. Here we derive a family of stochastic Ricker models using different combinations of all these stochastic factors, and show that extinction risk depends strongly on the combination of factors that contribute to stochasticity. Furthermore, we show that only with the full stochastic model can the relative importance of environmental and demographic variability, and therefore extinction risk, be correctly determined. Using the full model, we find that demographic sources of stochasticity are the prominent cause of variability in a laboratory population of Tribolium castaneum ( red flour beetle), whereas using only the standard simpler models would lead to the erroneous conclusion that environmental variability dominates. Our results demonstrate that current estimates of extinction risk for natural populations could be greatly underestimated because variability has been mistakenly attributed to the environment rather than the demographic factors described here that entail much higher extinction risk for the same variability level.},

	abstract = {A key question in both life history evolution and conservation biology is how much the contributions of different demographic processes to the rate of population growth vary from place to place. Using data from a six-year demographic study of five nearby populations, we asked, for the first time, how well the sensitivities and elasticities of the stochastic population growth rate (lambda(s)) to the means and standard deviations Of underlying vital rates (survival, growth, reversion, and reproduction) can be generalized among populations. Relying on Tuljapurkar's approximation for X,, we used standard mathematical formulas for the sensitivities and elasticities of X, to the vital rate means, and we derived approximations for the sensitivities and elasticities of X, to the vital rate standard deviations. No single vital rate mean or standard deviation had the highest stochastic sensitivity or elasticity across all five populations. However, the summed sensitivities and elasticities of different types of vital rates were much more consistent: the mean survival rates had the highest summed sensitivity and elasticity, and the standard deviations of growth or reversion rates had the highest summed sensitivity or elasticity in all populations. The rank order of the individual sensitivities and elasticities of the vital rate means were, in general, also highly correlated among populations, with the exception of one population that showed a distinctive sensitivity/elasticity pattern, but the sensitivities and elasticities of the vital rate standard deviations were less correlated among populations. Environmental variables (geographical location, elevation, and geological parent material) did not predict the degree of similarity in sensitivity/elasticity patterns between population pairs. Our results show that overall patterns in the stochastic sensitivities and elasticities of mean vital rates can be extrapolated accurately across closely adjacent populations, but that caution is needed when extrapolating sensitivities/elasticities of vital rate standard deviations or when applying the single most important vital rate from one population to others.},

Additionally, it is shown that stage structure bounds nonequilibrium behavior relative to the case without stage structure. Finally, it is shown that the increased stability and bounding of solutions has the seemingly paradoxical consequence of promoting nonequilibrium dynamics when even small amounts of noise are added to the system.

By using data from acoustic and bottom trawl surveys in the Barents Sea conducted in February 1988-1995, mean length at age is related to the winter temperature. Mean lengths at age increased with increasing temperature for cod of age 2-6. Mean individual growth was highest for year classes experiencing high temperatures. Due to the seasonal migration patterns of cod, the actual annual means of ambient temperature as well as the differences between these means are loner than the values from February alone, used in this study. Thus. by using the ambient winter temperature instead of annual mean values the effect temperature has on growth is probably underestimated. Increased abundance of young cod is associated with an extension of the distribution area towards east and north into colder water. Even though the individual consumption of capelin by cod increased in these years, the increase in abundance was accompanied by reduced growth. Hence a growth-temperature relation may wrongly be interpreted as a growth-density (abundance) dependency if ambient temperature is not included in the analysis.

	abstract = {Successful spawning of cod in the Baltic is restricted to the deep basins: the Bornholm basin, the Gdansk Deep and the Gotland basin, at salinities varying between 11 and 20 psu. Due to oxygen-depletion commonly prevailing in these areas. neutral egg buoyancy above oxygen-critical levels is of substantial importance for egg and larval survival in the Baltic. In the present study, large females were found to produce larger eggs with neutral egg buoyancy at a lower salinity, implying egg development in more favourable oxygen conditions. An age- and batch-specific model of egg production, egg size and egg buoyancy showed a substantial increase in the probability of egg survival with female age. The relationship between egg production by old females and subsequent recruitment was tested in two separated periods with different conditions: 1967-1980 and 1981-1994. The number of recruited cod (age 2), in the Baltic Sea, was positively related to the fraction of eggs produced by old females (greater than or equal to5 years). That recruitment was positively related to the proportion of eggs spawned by old fish reveals that stock age structure should be seriously considered in stock-recruitment relationships and in the management of the cod stock in the Baltic.

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with 'knot placement' that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

We then analyse two large collections of data sets with autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models, using model selection techniques to find best-fitting models. We estimated two metrics of population regulation: the characteristic return rate of populations to stationarity and the variability of the stationary distribution (the long-term distribution of population abundance). Empirically, longer time series were more likely to show weakly regulated population dynamics. For data sets of length {\textgreater}= 20, more than 35{\textbackslash}\% had characteristic return times {\textgreater} 6 years, and more than 29{\textbackslash}\% had stationary distributions whose coefficients of variation were more than two times greater than would be the case if they were maximally regulated. These results suggest that many natural populations are weakly regulated. Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 21-31.},

	abstract = {An experimental study was performed to disentangle parental and environmental effects on the growth of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua larvae and juveniles. Eggs were collected during the spawning season from spawning pairs (families) kept separately in specially designed spawning compartments. Newly hatched larvae were released simultaneously into two mesocosms of 2500 and 4400 m3. Larval growth was monitored by sampling over a 10 week period, after which juveniles were transferred to on-growing tanks, where they were tagged and kept for up to 2 years. Maternal origin was determined by individual microsatellite genotyping of the larvae (n = 3949, 24 families) and juveniles (n = 600). The results showed significant positive correlations between egg size and larval size during the whole mesocosm period. Correlations, however, weakened with time and were no longer significant at the first tank-rearing sampling at an age of 9 months. Significant family-specific differences in growth were observed. The coefficient of variation (c.v.) was calculated in order to examine variation in standard length of larvae during the mesocosm period. Inter-family c.v. was on average 69{\textbackslash}\% of intra-family c.v. Differences in zooplankton densities between the two mesocosms were reflected in larval growth, condition factor and c.v. Low food abundance appeared to reduce c.v. and favour growth of larvae that showed relatively slow growth at high food abundance. It is suggested that genetically determined variation in growth potential is maintained by environmental variability.},

But in the late 1980s and early 1990s, northern cod underwent one of the worst collapses in the history of fisheries(2-4). The Canadian government closed the directed fishing for northern cod in July 1992, but even after a decade-long offshore moratorium, population sizes remain historically low(4). Here we show that, up until the moratorium, the life history of northern cod continually shifted towards maturation at earlier ages and smaller sizes. Because confounding effects of mortality changes and growth-mediated phenotypic plasticity are accounted for in our analyses, this finding strongly suggests fisheries-induced evolution of maturation patterns in the direction predicted by theory(5,6). We propose that fisheries managers could use the method described here as a tool to provide warning signals about changes in life history before more overt evidence of population decline becomes manifest.},

Particularly, attention was paid to whether a density-dependant factor, such as a stock-recruitment relationship (S-R relationship) or a density-independent factor such as an environmental factor, is more important. Using data pertaining to the number of eggs of the Pacific stock mackerel and information about regime shifts and sea surface temperature, the shape of the S-R relationship was discussed and these shapes with the results of simulation trails were compared. Further other historical S-R relationship data were analyzed. The results are as follows: (i) a new mechanism that causes population fluctuations could be proposed, that is, (a) the recruitment is proportional to the spawning stock biomass (SSB) and the relation is expressed by several lines with the same slope, and (b) the shift between the lines occurs due to environmental conditions; and (ii) the density-dependent S-R relationship, which suggests that recruitment decreased due to high density in SSB, proposed by Ricker or Beverton and Holt, would not exist.},

Where it has been examined, the effects of overfishing have cascaded down the food chain. In an intensively fished area on the western Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic, the biomass of prey species increased exponentially (doubling time of 11 years) even though the aggregate biomass of their predators remained stable over 38 years. Concomitant reductions in herbivorous zooplankton and increases in phytoplankton were also evident. This anomalous trophic pattern led us to examine how declines in predator body size (approx. 60{\textbackslash}\% in body mass since the early 1970s) and climatic regime influenced lower trophic levels. The increase in prey biomass was associated primarily with declines in predator body size and secondarily to an increase in stratification. Sea surface temperature and predator biomass had no influence. A regression model explained 65 per cent of prey biomass variability. Trait-mediated effects, namely a reduction in predator size, resulted in a weakening of top predation pressure. Increased stratification may have enhanced growing conditions for prey fish. Size-selective harvesting under changing climatic conditions initiated a trophic restructuring of the food chain, the effects of which may have influenced three trophic levels.},

	abstract = {1. Population dynamics often defy predictions based on empirical models, and explanations for noisy dynamics have ranged from deterministic chaos to environmental stochasticity. Transient (short-term) dynamics following disturbance or perturbation have recently gained empirical attention from researchers as further possible effectors of complicated dynamics. 2. Previously published methods of transient analysis have tended to require knowledge of initial population structure. However, this has been overcome by the recent development of the parametric Kreiss bound (which describes how large a population must become before reaching its maximum possible transient amplification following a disturbance) and the extension of this and other transient indices to simultaneously describe both amplified and attenuated transient dynamics. 3. We apply the Kreiss bound and other transient indices to a data base of matrix models from 108 plant species, in an attempt to detect ecological and mathematical patterns in the transient dynamical properties of plant populations. 4. We describe how life history influences the transient dynamics of plant populations: species at opposite ends of the scale of ecological succession have the highest potential for transient amplification and attenuation, whereas species with intermediate life history complexity have the lowest potential. 5. We find ecological relationships between transients and asymptotic dynamics: faster-growing populations tend to have greater potential magnitudes of transient amplification and attenuation, which could suggest that short- and long-term dynamics are similarly influenced by demographic parameters or vital rates. 6. We describe a strong dependence of transient amplification and attenuation on matrix dimension: perhaps signifying a potentially worrying artefact of basic model parameterization. 7.Synthesis. Transient indices describe how big or how small plant populations can get, en route to long-term stable rates of increase or decline. The patterns we found in the potential for transient dynamics, across many species of plants, suggest a combination of ecological and modelling strategy influences. This better understanding of transients should guide the formulation of management and conservation strategies for all plant populations that suffer disturbances away from stable equilibria.},

	title = {The year-class phenomenon and the storage effect in marine fishes},
	volume = {57},
	abstract = {Factors contributing to population growth through strong year-class formation have driven a century of directed research in fisheries science. A central discovery of Hjort's paradigm was that multiple generations overlap and longevity is matched with frequency of strong recruitments. Here, I elaborate on this tenet by examining how intra-population modalities in spawning and early habitat use favour population resiliency. A modem theory that has application is the storage effect [Warner, R.R., Chesson, P.L., 1985. Coexistence mediated by recruitment fluctuations - a field guide to the storage effect. Am. Nat. 125, 769-787], whereby spawning stock biomass accumulates each year so that when early survival conditions are favourable, stored egg production can result in explosive population growth. I review two early life history behaviours that contribute to the storage effect: split cohorts (i.e., seasonal pulses of eggs and larvae) and contingent behaviour (i.e., dispersive and retentive patterns in early dispersal). Episodic and pulsed production of larvae is a common feature for marine fishes, well documented through otolith microstructure and hatch-date analyses. In temperate and boreal fishes, early and late spawned cohorts of larvae and juveniles may have differing fates dependent upon seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in weather and climate. Often, a coastal fish may spawn for a protracted period, yet only a few days' egg production will result in successful recruitment. In these and other instances, it is clear that diversity in spawning behaviour can confer resilience against temporal variations in early survival conditions. Although many factors contribute to intra-population spawning modalities, size and age structure of adults play an important role. Contingent structure, an idea dating to Hjort (herring contingents) and Gilbert (salmon contingents), has been resurrected to describe the diversity of intra-population modalities observed through otolith microchemical and electronic tagging approaches. Retentive and dispersive behaviours confer resiliency against early survival conditions that vary spatially. Examples of contingent structure are increasingly numerous for diadromous fishes. Here, a nursery habitat associated with a contingent behaviour may make a small contribution in a given year, but over a decade contribute significantly to spawning stock biomass. For flatfish and other marine fishes, contingent structure is probable but not well documented. Proximate factors leading to contingent structure are poorly known, but for diadromous fishes, time of spawning and early life history energetic thresholds is hypothesized to lead to alternative life cycles. Here again time of spawning may lead to the storage effect by hedging against spatial variance in early vital rates. Managing for the storage effect will be promoted by conservation of adult age structure and early habitats upon which both strong and weak year-classes rely. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Abstract: Positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function are described from an increasing number of systems, but the underlying mechanisms frequently remain elusive. A truly predictive understanding of biodiversityâ€“ecosystem function relationships requires the a priori identification of traits conferring specific (and possibly complementary) functions to individual species. Although planktonic organisms are responsible for approximately half of the worldâ€™s primary production, few studies have reported on the relationship between phytoplankton biodiversity and planktonic primary production. We argue that taxonâ€specific differential equipment with photosynthetically active pigments provides a biochemical mechanism of resource use complementarity among phototrophic microorganisms, enabling more diverse communities to more completely harvest the light spectrum. In line with this, more diverse phytoplankton communities showed higher pigment diversity, higher biomassâ€specific light absorbance, and higher rates of primary production and biomass accrual.},

	volume = {257},
	abstract = {Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) held in 11.6-13.0 degrees C sea water were fed to satiation for 126 days, I of 12 diets formulated to contain equivalent crude protein (500 g/kg) and gross energy contents (21.2-21.6 MJ/kg). The diets contained two different supplemental levels of copper (10 or 35 mg/kg; determined levels ranged from 7 to 14 or 24 to 40 mg/kg) and iron (333 or 1000 mg/kg; determined levels ranged from 667 to 760 or 1405 to 1557 mg/kg) and either unoxidized or actively oxidizing (+) supplemental herring oil (145.7 g/kg) as measured by the initial peroxide value (PV; {\textless} 5, {\textless} 5+ or 3 5+ meq/kg). Lipid peroxidation in the diets containing unoxidized lipid (PV, {\textless} meq/kg) from fishmeal and oil was minimized by adding the antioxidant, ethoxyquin (EQ; 150 mg/kg). All diets contained the required level of vitamin E (30 fU/kg). Diets supplemented with the highest level of iron, without EQ showed the greatest loss of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) and vitamin E (p {\textless} 0.05). Fish fed these diets also exhibited significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) lower growth, feed intake, feed efficiency, and efficiency of utilization of crude protein and gross energy. Vitamin E concentrations decreased over the duration of the feeding trial for all diets except those low in iron and peroxide value and with ethoxyquin supplementation. Diets without EQ supplementation had significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher lipid peroxidation as assessed by malondialdehyde levels when compared to diets with EQ. However, there were no diet-related effects on in vitro indicators of fish hepatic and muscle tissue lipid peroxidation as assessed by malondialdehyde levels, selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity or concentration of conjugated dienes. Autopsy-based assessments of general health indicated that fish fed diets undergoing iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation exhibited dietary vitamin E, EPA and DHA deficiency symptoms. However, hematology and innate immune parameters did not reveal any diet effects, with the exception of erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOS) which significantly increased in diets low in vitamin E, EPA and DHA. In summary, our results suggest that deficiencies in EPA and DHA and vitamin E in the salmon fed diets undergoing iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation adversely influenced growth, general health, and fillet fatty acid composition of the fish. Oxidized dietary lipids did not influence in vitro oxidative stress parameters measured in this study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We conducted population projections taking into account uncertainty in current abundance-at-age and uncertainty or variability in each of the components of population productivity (i.e., rates of recruitment, individual growth, and adult natural mortality). We defined extirpation as a spawning stock biomass less than 1000 t ({\textless} 0.3{\textbackslash}\% of historical levels). Based on these projections, at its current level of productivity, this population is certain to be extirpated within 40 years in the absence of fishing and in 20 years with fishery removals at the level of the total allowable catch in 2007 and 2008 (2000 t). Elevated natural mortality of adult cod (M) is the main factor contributing to the low productivity of this stock. Because M appears to be increasing, our projections are likely overly optimistic.},

They breed for a shorter period, produce fewer egg batches, exhibit lower fecundity, and produce smaller eggs with lower fertilization and hatching rates; moreover, their larvae are less likely to hatch in environmental conditions favorable for survival. Batch-average egg diameters of first-time spawners underwent a continuous rapid decline between initial and terminal batches, whereas second-time spawners commonly exhibited a parabolic curve (slight increase followed by a decrease). Seasonal composite hatching rates of all eggs spawned by first- and second-time spawners were 13 and 628, respectively. Larval production per maternal gram was an order of magnitude greater for second-time than for first-time spawners (200 versus 20 larvae/g). Batch-average egg diameter declined 11{\textbackslash}\% and larval dry weight declined 29{\textbackslash}\% from initial to terminal batches when data were pooled over both spawner types. Egg diameter correlated positively with larval dry weight, yolk dry weight, and ratio of yolk to larval dry weight. Additional monitoring of individuals between the first and second breeding year confirmed results obtained on 12 cod pairs monitored during the same year at constant temperature. These results have a direct bearing on the development of mathematical models of spawner-recruitment relationships, and they suggest that conventional approaches may overestimate the reproductive potential of age-truncated populations.},

This may reflect evolutionary change in response to the highly selective mortality imposed by fisheries. Recent experimental work has demonstrated a rapid genetic change in growth rate in response to size-selective harvesting of laboratory fish populations. Here, we use a 30-year time-series of back-calculated lengths-at-age to test for a genetic response to size-selective mortality in the wild in a heavily exploited population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Controlling for the effects of density- and temperature-dependent growth, the change in mean length of 4-year-old cod between offspring and their parental cohorts was positively correlated with the estimated selection differential experienced by the parental cohorts between this age and spawning. This result supports the hypothesis that there have been genetic changes in growth in this population in response to size-selective fishing. Such changes may account for the continued small size-at-age in this population despite good conditions for growth and little fishing for over a decade. This study highlights the need for management regimes that take into account the evolutionary consequences of fishing.},

	abstract = {1. Matrix models are popular tools for plant demographic studies, but their application to long-lived, slow-growing species is hampered by the fact that (i) model output is highly sensitive to category width and (ii) growth variation between individuals can only be partially accounted for. Integral Projection Models (IPMs) - an extension of matrix models - offer a solution to these problems. 2. Here, we introduce a new method to parameterize IPMs for trees - the `integration method'- which allows constructing IPMs for long-lived, slow-growing species. This approach is more suitable than the `midpoint rule', which is customarily used. 3. We built IPMs for six tree species from Vietnamese (sub)tropical forests. For four of these species, population growth rate (lambda) was highly sensitive to the number of categories in the transition matrix. Population growth stabilized for IPMs with 100-1000 categories, corresponding to categories of 0.1-1 cm in trunk diameter. This preferred width is much narrower than the 10-cm-wide categories customarily used in tree models. 4. The distribution of elasticity values over transition types (stasis, progression to next and further categories) is also highly sensitive to matrix dimension in IPMs. In addition, elasticity distribution is influenced by including or excluding growth variation. 5. Age estimates obtained from IPMs were also highly sensitive to matrix dimension: an IPM with 1000 size categories yielded 2-4 times higher age estimates for large trees than one with 10 size categories. Observed ages obtained from tree ring analyses for four of the study species allowed validating these estimates. IPMs with 10 categories strongly underestimated age, while those with 1000 categories yielded slight age overestimates. Underestimating age in small matrices is caused by the occurrence of unrealistically fast pathways through the life cycle and is probably widespread among tree models with broad categories. Overestimating ages in IPMs with narrow categories may be due to temporally autocorrelated growth or errors in fitting growth curves. 6. Synthesis. IPMs are highly suitable tools to analyse tree demography. We recommend that tree IPMs (and classical matrix models) apply narrow diameter categories (0.1-1 cm width) to obtain reliable model output.},

Although small-scale experiments have documented the importance of maternal quality to offspring survival in plants and animals, the effects of this association on the recruitment dynamics of exploited populations are largely unknown. Here, we present results from both a simple population model and a meta-analysis of time-series data from 25 species of exploited marine fishes that suggest that a population of older, larger individuals has a higher maximum reproductive rate than an equivalent population of younger, smaller individuals, and that this difference increases with the reproductive lifespan of the population. These findings (i) establish an empirical link between population age structure and reproductive rate that is consistent with strong effects of maternal quality on population dynamics and (ii) provide further evidence that extended age structure is essential to the sustainability of many exploited fish stocks.},

	abstract = {The probabilistic maturation reaction norm approach has been widely heralded as an empirical approach to distinguish between the effects of genetic selection and phenotypic plasticity on maturation probability. However, applications of this approach have considered maturation state in relation to fish size long after the period when fish make the `decision' to mature. Evidence, mostly from salmonids, indicates that maturation is controlled by successive hormonal inhibition linked to energy state during critical periods of the year. Thus, any genetic selection cannot be acting upon the size of fish late in the reproductive cycle, but rather during the timing of these critical periods. Indeed, experimental studies demonstrate that size attained by late stages of gametogenesis need not necessarily be a good predictor of the probability of maturing. Therefore, changes in energy status around the time of maturation decisions represent an unknown and possibly significant source of variability in the reaction norm midpoints. Clearly, there is a need to apply physiologically realistic models of maturation probability - as have been developed for Atlantic salmon - to other fish species. Future investigation of fisheries -induced evolution may also benefit from examining historical changes in fecundity and by comparing current reproductive investment in fish from heavily and lightly exploited populations that are held under common-garden conditions.},

Genetic constraints occur when additive genetic variance in selectively favored directions is absent (absolute constraints) or present but small (quantitative constraints). Quantitativeâ€”unlike absoluteâ€”constraints are presumed surmountable given time. This ignores that a population might become extinct before reaching the favored state, in which case demography effectively converts a quantitative into an absolute constraint. Here, we derive criteria for predicting when such conversions occur. We model the demography and evolution of populations subject to optimizing selection that experience either a single shift or a constant change in the optimum. In the singleâ€shift case, we consider whether a population can evolve significantly without declining or else declines temporarily while avoiding low sizes consistent with high extinction risk. We analyze when populations in constantly changing environments evolve sufficiently to ensure longâ€term growth. From these, we derive formulas for critical levels of genetic variability that define demographyâ€caused absolute constraints. The formulas depend on estimable properties of fitness, population size, or environmental change rates. Each extends to selection on multivariate traits. Our criteria define the nearly null space of a populationâ€™s G matrix, the set of multivariate directions effectively inaccessible to it via adaptive evolution.},

Brief periods of food deprivation are often followed by a period of accelerated (compensatory) growth. Early laboratory studies likewise reported a contraction of genetic variance in size as maturation approached. However, studies of wild populations often contradict these laboratory results. One possibility is that environmentally imposed stress is exposing genetic variance not seen in the laboratory. We tested the effect of rearing environment (high or low food) on genetic variance in size traits measured at two ages in the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis. A substantial amount of genetic variance was present in all combinations of rearing environment by ontogenetic stage among males. The pattern of change in male variance in mass over ontogeny was of opposite sign in the two food treatments, which may reflect cryptic genetic variance that is apparent only under stress. The proportion of overall variance that was due to additive genetic effects was much lower in females than in males, which suggests that the underlying genetics of female growth trajectories differs from that males. Our experimental design afforded an initial exploration of the genetics of compensatory growth.},

Recent discussions concerning ecosystem ``regime shifts'' again raise the question of whether population fluctuations are mainly controlled by external forcing. Results of nonlinear time series analyses indicate that pelagic populations typically do not passively track stochastic environmental variables. Rather, population dynamics are better described as nonlinear amplification of physical forcing by biological interactions. However, we illustrate that in some cases populations do show linear tracking of the physical environment. To explain why population dynamics can sometimes be linear, we propose the linear tracking window hypothesis: populations are most likely to track the stochastic environmental forcing when their generation time matches the characteristic time scale of the environmental signal. While our observations follow this hypothesis well, our results indicate that the linear tracking window is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.},

The relationship assumes that spawner biomass (in tonnes) is proportional to the total number of eggs produced (TEP) by the stock(3), an assumption under increasing challenge(4-8). Most stocks require proxies for TEP because contemporary and/or historical fecundity data are lacking. Here we show a positive association between recruitment and the liver weights of spawners in the Barents Sea cod stock which suggests that recruitment is constrained by the amount of lipid energy stored in the liver. This stimulated our interest in estimating total lipid energy (TLE; in kilojoules) for mature females in the stock. We examined the suitability of TLE as a proxy through correlation and simulation analyses. The results indicate that TLE is proportional to TEP and exhibits a similar response to varying food abundance. Replacing spawner biomass with more accurate measures of reproductive potential is essential to developing a rational basis for stock conservation(9). Correctly specifying the first-order maternal effect on TEP is a prerequisite to detecting environmental and ecological effects on recruitment(10).},

Recent empirical information. however, suggests that reproduction by older and experienced females is more successful than by young and inexperienced females. New models are developed incorporating the proportion of each age group spawning for the first. second, etc., time (from information contained in the maturity ogive) and differences in the survival of eggs and larvae in relation to the demography of spawners (based on experimental results). A series of spawning metrics [spawning-stock biomass (SSB), egg production, hatched egg production. viable larval production] and associated recruitment-based fishing mortality reference points (F-med, F-crash, and the F that allows at least one lifetime spawning per recruit) are contrasted for the Georges Bank Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. The time-series of spawning intensity is significantly altered when hatched eggs or viable larvae are used as the metric. reflecting the contribution of first- and second-time spawners in some years. and the increasing trend in F. The effect of reduced average maternal size in relation to egg viability was a more important factor contributing to discrepancies with SSB than was spawning experience in relation to hatching success. Percent maximum spawning potential ({\textbackslash}\%MSP) per recruit curves in relation to F are steeper (i.e, result in lower values of {\textbackslash}\%MSP for a given F) for hatched eggs and viable larvae than for SSB or egg production per recruit. Lifetime expected numbers of spawnings per recruit are significantly reduced when the effects of spawning experience on egg hatching success are included, And finally. although point estimates of F-med and F-crash are similar using SSB and viable larval production, the median F-crash estimated from 5000 bootstrap realizations of the Beverton-Holt stock recruitment Curve for viable larvae is much lower than that from SSB. with narrower confidence bounds. Our results suggest that traditional approaches to F-based reference points using SSB systematically overestimate the resiliency of stocks to fishing. If age-at-spawning is at least partially heritable, then intense fishing on younger ages may exert high levels of selection for early maturity with negative impacts on net reproductive effort and trait diversity.},

	abstract = {The actuarial senescence (i.e., the rate of increase in adult mortality with age) was related to body mass, development period, and age at sexual maturity across 124 taxonomic families of terrestrial vertebrates. Model selection based on Akaike's information criterion values adjusted for small size showed that the rate of aging decreases with increasing body mass, gestation period, age at maturity, and possession of flight. Among families of mammals, actuarial senescence was related to extrinsic mortality rate (standardized regression coefficient = 0.215), gestation period (âˆ’0.217), and age at maturity (âˆ’0.553). Although rate of aging in birds also was related to the embryo development period, birds grow several times more rapidly than mammals, and therefore, the connection between rate of early development and rate of aging is unclear. The strong vertebrate-wide relationship between rate of aging, or life span, and age at maturity can be explained by density-dependent feedback of adult survival rate on the recruitment of young individuals into the breeding population. Thus, age at maturity seems to reflect extrinsic mortality, which, in turn, influences selection on mechanisms that postpone physiological and actuarial senescence. Because rate of embryo development influences rate of aging independently of the age at maturity, in a statistical sense, the evolutionary diversification of development and aging seem to be connected in both birds and mammals; however, the linking mechanisms are not known.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), components of reproductive success besides fecundity are size dependent. However, managers setting escapement goals usually estimate reproductive potential of a stock in terms of total number of spawners, number of female spawners, or potential egg deposition given a mean size of spawners. Interannual variation in size composition of spawners may thus result in errors in assessing reproductive potential. Here, we develop models of recruitment and harvest and determine optimal size-selective harvesting strategies. These optimal strategies range from the current large-fish harvests (larger-than-average fish are caught, leaving smaller fish to spawn) to small-fish harvests, where the reverse is true. If the body mass (M) of individual spawners increases more rapidly than reproductive success (RS) with respect to increasing length of adult females (e.g., if number of eggs alone best measures RS), then sustainable biomass yield is maximized by the current large-fish harvest. However, if RS/M increases with increasing length of females (e.g., if total biomass of eggs best measures RS), then small-fish harvest maximizes sustainable yield. Evidence suggests that some salmon populations show this latter pattern; thus, large-fish harvests may generate suboptimal yields.},

	abstract = {A comparison between the northwestern Hawaiian islands (NWHI), a large, remote, and lightly fished area, and the main Hawaiian islands (MHI), an urbanized, heavily fished area, revealed dramatic differences in the numerical density, size, and biomass of the shallow reef fish assemblages. Grand mean fish standing stock in the NWHI was more than 260{\textbackslash}\% greater than in the MHI. The most striking difference was the abundance and size of large apex predators (primarily sharks and jacks) in the NWHI compared to the MHI. More than 54{\textbackslash}\% of the total fish biomass in the NWHI consisted of apex predators, whereas this trophic level accounted for less than 3{\textbackslash}\% of the fish biomass in the MHI. In contrast, fish biomass in the MHI was dominated by herbivores (55{\textbackslash}\%) and small-bodied lower-level carnivores (42{\textbackslash}\%). Most of the dominant species by weight in the NWHI were either rare or absent in the MHI and the target species that were present, regardless of trophic level, were nearly always larger in the NWHI, These differences represent both near-extirpation of apex predators and heavy exploitation of lower trophic levels in the MHI compared to the largely unfished NWHI. The reefs in the NWHI are among the few remaining large-scale, intact, predator-dominated reef ecosystems left in the world and offer an opportunity to understand how unaltered ecosystems are structured, how they function, and how they can most effectively be preserved. The differences in fish assemblage structure in this study are evidence of the high level of exploitation in the MHI and the pressing need for ecosystem-level management of reef systems in the MHI as well as the NWHI.},

	abstract = {This review is based on 58 climate-fisheries models published over the last 28 years that describe the impacts of fishery pressure and environmental variability on populations and ecosystems and include basic principles of population dynamics. It points out that the incorporation of environmental factors in fishery models has already been done and is of great importance for future models used in the assessment of marine resources. The work is guided by the questions to what extent have these models a) enhanced our understanding of the interrelationships between the environment, the fishery and the state of the exploited resources and b) helped to improve the prediction of population dynamics and the assessment of marine resources. For each of the six most commonly used model categories a case study is critically analyzed. The problems of ``breaking relationships'' between environmental factors and the biological response used in models, the trade-off between model complexity (realism) and simplicity (data availability) and the potential of multivariate climate indices for forecasting ecosystem states and for use as proxies for combined models are discussed, as are novel non-linear and spatially explicit modeling approaches. Approaches differ in terms of model complexity, use of linear or non-linear equations, number of parameters, forecast time horizon and type of resource modelled. A majority of the models were constructed for fish and invertebrate stocks of the northeast Pacific and the epicontinental seas of the Atlantic, reflecting the advancement of fisheries science in these regions. New, in parts highly complex models and sophisticated approaches were identified. The reviewed studies demonstrate that the performance of fished stocks can better be described if environmental or climatic variability is incorporated into the fisheries models. We conclude that due to the already available knowledge, the greatly enhanced computer power, new methods and recent findings of large-scale climatic/oceanographic cycles, fisheries modeling should progress greatly in the coming years.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Maternal effects are environmental components of phenotypes that complicate relationships between natural selection and evolution because they often affect phenotypes and fitness simultaneously. We studied the effects of egg size variation on juvenile survival in a population of American coots (Fulica americana). We experimentally evaluated egg size variation at three levels: across the population, within natal nests, and within foster nests. Natal nests accounted for the most variation in population egg size. Within clutches, earlyâ€laid eggs were larger than laterâ€laid eggs, with the exception of firstâ€laid eggs, which were small. In the fostering experiment, posthatching survival was most strongly related to egg size relative to natal siblings and natal hatching order and less so to egg size within foster nests. These effects on survival were found even though young from natal nests were neither raised together nor raised by genetic parents. These results indicate that females allocate resources unequally among offspring such that offspring from larger, earlyâ€laid eggs have higher survival than offspring from smaller, laterâ€laid eggs, regardless of their size relative to foster siblings or to mean population egg size. These results suggest that egg size variation can be maintained through selection on maternal investment strategies and not on egg size per se.},

	abstract = {Interspecific patterns of fish life histories were evaluated in relation to several theoretical models of life-history evolution. Data were gathered for 216 North American fish species (57 families) to explore relationships among variables and to ordinate species. Multivariate tests, performed on freshwater, marine, and combined data matrices, repeatedly identified a gradient associating later-maturing fishes with higher fecundity, small eggs, and few bouts of reproduction during a short spawning season and the opposite suite of traits with small fishes. A second strong gradient indicated positive associations between parental care, egg size, and extended breeding seasons. Phylogeny affected each variable, and some higher taxonomic groupings were associated with particular life-history strategies. High-fecundity characteristics tended to be associated with large species ranges in the marine environment. Age at maturation, adult growth rate, life span, and egg size positively correlated with anadromy. Parental care was inversely correlated with median latitude. A trilateral continuum based on essential trade-offs among three demographic variables predicts many of the correlations among life-history traits. This framework has implications for predicting population responses to diverse natural and anthropogenic disturbances and provides a basis for comparing responses of different species to the same disturbance.},

	abstract = {Worldwide declines of fish stocks raise concerns about deleterious consequences of harvesting for stock abundances and individual life histories, and call for appropriate recovery strategies. Fishes in exploited stocks mature earlier at either larger or smaller sizes due to both genetic and plastic responses. The latter occur commonly when reduced competition for food leads to faster growth. Using a size-structured consumer-resource model, which accounts for both genetic and plastic responses, we show that fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in individual life history and stock properties can easily become irreversible. As a result of annual spawning, early maturation at small sizes and late maturation at large sizes can become alternative, evolutionarily and ecologically stable states under otherwise identical environmental conditions. Exploitation of late-maturing populations can then induce an evolutionary regime shift to smaller maturation sizes associated with stepwise, 1-year decreases in age at first reproduction. Complete and early fishing moratoria slowly reverse this process, but belated or partial closure of fisheries may accelerate or even instigate further evolution to smaller sizes at maturation. We suggest that stepwise decreases in maturation age can be used as early warnings of upcoming evolutionary changes, and should inspire timely restrictions of fisheries.},

	abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50- year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ( CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age- truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

Although biologists have known about the importance of these effects for decades, maternal effects have only recently been studied widely by evolutionary ecologists. Moreover, the impact of maternal effects on the rate and direction of evolution of other components of the phenotype has only recently been fully elucidated by theoretical genetic models. This paper provides a brief overview of maternal effects research, focusing on research conducted in animal systems. First, I review and summarize definitions and theoretical treatments of maternal effects. Then I survey the diversity of maternal effects and some of the kinds of ecological and evolutionary impacts that maternal effects have been shown to have on offspring performance. Third, I discuss some of the ecological and evolutionary implications of maternal effects in ecological research. In this context, it is argued that the kinds of maternal effects that have been studied, and some of the potential implications of maternal effects that have not been explored are both artifacts of research effort. Hence, I identify several fruitful areas for future maternal effects research. Lastly, I describe the necessity of explicitly incorporating maternal effects in ecological research, whether or not the researcher is focusing on them as the topic of the research.},

	title = {The particular maternal effect of propagule size, especially egg size: {Patterns}, models, quality of evidence and interpretations},
	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Propagule size is perhaps the most widely recognized and studied maternal effect in ecology, yet its evolution is not well-understood. The large body of extant optimality theory treats parental investment solely as an ecological problem, largely from the perspective of progeny. This approach has had limited success explaining the ubiquitous variation in propagule size within and among natural populations at most temporal and spatial scales. This problem aside, an unassailable gap in propagule size theory is that it pays little heed to the fact that offspring size is a joint phenotype of two individuals- the offspring and its mother. Hence, the ecology of mothers is decidedly as important in shaping the evolution of propagule size phenotypes. There are two reasons to suspect that this gap may account for the lack of success of optimality theory to explain variation in nature. The first is that optimality models of propagule size make no allowance for, nor can they explain, widespread, multivariate correlations between maternal characters and clutch parameters, namely the positive phenotypic covariances of maternal age, size, fecundity, and per-propagule investment found in many organisms. If per-propagule investment is optimized by selection based on the expectation of offspring fitness, then why should that phenotype be a function of maternal age or size when the ecological circumstances of progeny are not changing as a function of maternal age or size? The second gap in current theory is that, like all optimization theory, it is patently non-genetic in that it is assumed that the phenotypes optimized are evolutionarily accessible. Recent maternal effects theory indicates that traits subject to maternal influence behave in unanticipated ways. Specifically, there may be time lags in response to selection, and hence, selection away from the optimum phenotype. This paper explores a suite of issues pertaining to the evolution of propagule size from the broader perspective of propagule size as a maternal effect (PSME) with a goal of widening the lens through which propagule size is viewed by evolutionary ecologists. Two themes are developed. First, I suggest that, to understand egg size variance and its implications for both maternal and offspring fitness, it is necessary to consider explicitly the ecological context in which a mother is producing eggs, not just that into which offspring will enter. I argue that some of the variables that have only been incorporated in pairwise fashion (or not at all) into studies of propagule size might account for the lack of agreement about how this important life history feature evolves. Further, I suggest that failure to consider other sources of selection on maternal phenotypes, driven by a narrow adaptationist view that has historically been taken of PSMEs, has obfuscated many interesting questions surrounding their coevolution with maternal characters. Thus, the second theme is that it is necessary to consider other explanations for why propagule size varies apart from those pertaining to offspring fitness per se'. Based on a detailed review of the empirical literature, I conclude that the concept of an optimal propagule size is not only an insufficient construct to explain the evolution of propagule size, but that continued reliance on an optimization approach is likely to stifle development of more realistic and predictive theory for the evolution of this key life history trait. Novel theory should incorporate realities from physiology, development and genetics and should accommodate the dynamic nature of the selective environments in which propagule size evolves, all of which have been shown by empiricists to play a role in determining propagule size phenotypes. A key feature of this theory should be the explicit treatment of propagule size as a maternal effect.},

	abstract = {1. A primary goal of evolutionary ecology is to understand factors selecting for the diversity of life histories. Life-history components, such as time-to-reproduction, adult survivorship and fecundity, might differ among species because of variation in direct and indirect benefits of these life histories in different environments or might have lower-than-expected variability because of phylogenetic constraints. Here, we present a phylogenetic examination of demography and life histories using a data base of 204 terrestrial plant species. 2. Overall, statistical models without phylogeny were preferred to models with phylogeny for vital rates and elasticities, suggesting that they lacked phylogenetic signal and are evolutionarily labile. However, the effect of phylogeny was significant in models including sensitivities, suggesting that sensitivities exhibit greater phylogenetic signal than vital rates or elasticities. 3. Species with a greater age at first reproduction had lower fecundity, consistent with a cost of delayed reproduction, but only in some habitats (e.g. grassland). We found no evidence for an indirect benefit of delayed reproduction via a decrease in variation in fecundity with age to first reproduction. 4. The greater sensitivity and lower variation in survival than in fecundity was consistent with buffering of more important vital rates, as others have also found. This suggests that studies of life-history evolution should include survival, rather than only fecundity, for the majority of species. 5. Synthesis. Demographic matrix models can provide informative tests of life-history theory because of their shared construction and outputs and their widespread use among plant ecologists. Our comparative analysis suggested that there is a cost of delayed reproduction and that more important vital rates exhibit lower variability. The absolute importance of vital rates to population growth rates (sensitivities) exhibited phylogenetic signal, suggesting that a thorough understanding of life-history evolution might require an understanding of the importance of vital rates, not just their means, and the role of phylogenetic history.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of natural communities is the variation in size that can be observed between organisms, a variation that to a substantial degree is intraspecific. Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where PSPMs have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth. survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer-resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that PSPMs may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories. which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer-resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of PSPMs. Parameter values used in PSPMs adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time. PSPMs offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of PSPMs. We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using PSPMs.},

	abstract = {We formulate and analyze an archetypal consumer-resource model in terms of ordinary differential equations that consistently translates individual life history processes, in particular food-dependent growth in body size and stage-specific differences between juveniles and adults in resource use and mortality, to the population level. This stage-structured model is derived as an approximation to a physiologically structured population model, which accounts for a complete size-distribution of the consumer population and which is based on assumptions about the energy budget and size-dependent life history of individual consumers. The approximation ensures that under equilibrium conditions predictions of both models are completely identical. In addition we find that under non-equilibrium conditions the stage-structured model gives rise to dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics exhibited by the size-structured model, as long as adult consumers are superior foragers than juveniles with a higher mass-specific ingestion rate. When the mass-specific intake rate of juvenile consumers is higher, the size-structured model exhibits single-generation cycles, in which a single cohort of consumers dominates population dynamics throughout its life time and the population composition varies over time between a dominance by juveniles and adults, respectively. The stage-structured model does not capture these dynamics because it incorporates a distributed time delay between the birth and maturation of an individual organism in contrast to the size-structured model, in which maturation is a discrete event in individual life history. We investigate model dynamics with both semi-chemostat and logistic resource growth. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) are emerging as a flexible and general tool for characterizing phenotypic plasticity in maturation schedules. Describing an organism's probability of maturing as a function of its age and size, PMRNs offer several beneficial features: (1) PMRNs overcome systematic biases that previously marred the estimation of deterministic maturation reaction norms for populations with probabilistic growth and maturation; (2) PMRNs remove the effects of varying mortality rates and average juvenile somatic growth rates from descriptions of maturation schedules; (3) PMRNs are defined at the level of individuals and can thus be treated as phenotypes when applying methods of quantitative genetics; (4) PMRNs serve as indispensable ingredients in process-based dynamical models of a population's age and size structure; and (5) PMRNs are readily extended to include effects on maturation of individual or environmental factors other than age and size. Owing to this combination of features, PMRNs allow many effects of phenotypic plasticity to be stripped away from the description of maturation schedules, so that residual trends are suggestive of genetic adaptation in maturation schedules. Here we review the historical developments that led to the introduction of PMRNs and address frequently asked questions about their interpretation, utility, and application.},

	abstract = {The form of Darwinian selection has important ecological and management implications. Negative effects of harvesting are often ascribed to size truncation (i.e. strictly directional selection against large individuals) and resultant decrease in trait variability, which depresses capacity to buffer environmental change, hinders evolutionary rebound and ultimately impairs population recovery. However, the exact form of harvest-induced selection is generally unknown and the effects of harvest on trait variability remain unexplored. Here we use unique data from the Windermere (UK) long-term ecological experiment to show in a top predator (pike, ) that the fishery does not induce size truncation but disruptive (diversifying) selection, and does not decrease but rather increases variability in pike somatic growth rate and size at age. This result is supported by complementary modelling approaches removing the effects of catch selectivity, selection prior to the catch and environmental variation. Therefore, fishing most likely increased genetic variability for somatic growth in pike and presumably favoured an observed rapid evolutionary rebound after fishery relaxation. Inference about the mechanisms through which harvesting negatively affects population numbers and recovery should systematically be based on a measure of the exact form of selection. From a management perspective, disruptive harvesting necessitates combining a preservation of large individuals with moderate exploitation rates, and thus provides a comprehensive tool for sustainable exploitation of natural resources.},

	abstract = {1. Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses have been widely used to examine the sources of differences in the long-term deterministic growth rate (r = log lambda) of stage-structured populations that live in spatially distinct habitats or under distinct experimental conditions. However, existing methods for LTRE analysis ignore the fact that persistent temporal variation in matrix elements results in a long-term stochastic growth rate (a = log lambda(s)) that is different from the deterministic growth rate (r) and thus do not take into account environmental stochasticity. 2. Here, we develop a stochastic extension of LTRE methods that can be used to compare stochastic growth rates among populations that differ in the observed variability of their matrix elements over time. We illustrate our method with actual data and explore a range of questions that may be addressed with these new tools. Specifically, we investigate how variability in weather conditions affected the population dynamics of the short-lived perennial plant species Anthyllis vulneraria and examine how differences in stochastic growth rates (a) are determined by contributions of mean matrix elements and variability in matrix elements. 3. We find that, consistent with the life history of the species, differences in mean fertility and growth made the largest contribution to differences in a, whereas in terms of variability fertility made the largest contribution in most populations. However, we also find that in all populations, the magnitude of the total contribution of mean matrix elements outweighed that of variability. Finally, increasing soil depth significantly lowered contributions of variability in matrix elements, but it was not related to contributions of differences in mean matrix elements. 4.Synthesis. Stochastic life table response experiment analysis described here provides the first systematic way of incorporating observed differences in temporal variability into the comparison of natural populations. A key finding from this study is that populations occurring on relatively deeper soils were better buffered against climatic variation than populations occurring on shallow soils. We expect this new approach to analyse temporal variability to prove especially useful in the analysis of natural populations experiencing environmental change.},

By manipulating intraclutch variation in egg size and comparing siblings we examined the maternal effects of egg size on offspring performance and tested for the existence of reaction norms to environmental quality using the brown trout Salmo trutta. When sibling groups of small and large eggs were reared separately in a hatchery environment initial size differences disappeared rapidly. However, in semi-natural environments and under direct competition, juveniles from large eggs experienced growth and survival advantages over siblings from small eggs. Moreover, distinct reaction norms existed, with the differences in performance of juveniles from small and large eggs being most pronounced in the poorer growth environments. Our results provide the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, for a causal relationship between egg size and fitness-related traits in fishes, independent of potentially confounding genetic effects. Moreover, they indicate that previous studies have been biased by experimental conditions that excluded competitive asymmetries and environmental variability. The existence of reaction norms indicates a shift in optimal egg size across gradients of environmental quality that probably shapes the evolution of this trait.},

The theoretical tools for understanding this evolutionary trade-off between number and size of offspring have developed over the past 25 years(1,4-10); however, the absence of data on the relation between offspring size and fitness in highly fecund species, which would control for potentially confounding variables, has caused such models to remain largely hypothetical(11,12). Here we manipulate egg size, controlling for maternal trait interactions, and determine the causal consequences of offspring size in a wild population of Atlantic salmon. The joint effect of egg size on egg number and offspring survival resulted in stabilizing phenotypic selection for an optimal size. The optimal egg size differed only marginally from the mean value observed in the population, suggesting that it had evolved mainly in response to selection on maternal rather than offspring fitness. We conclude that maximization of maternal fitness by sacrificing offspring survival may well be a general phenomenon among highly fecund organisms.},

From a population dynamics perspective, spatial mateâ€finding problems are well studied, and decreased mateâ€finding efficiency at low population densities is a wellâ€recognized mechanism for the Allee effect. Temporal aspects of mate finding have been rarely considered, but reproductive asynchrony may engender an Allee effect in which some females go mateless by virtue of temporal isolation. Here we develop and explore a model that unifies previously disparate theoretical considerations of spatial and temporal aspects of mate finding. Specifically, we develop a twoâ€sex reactionâ€diffusion system to examine the interplay between reproductive asynchrony and the dispersal of individuals out of a patch. We also consider additional behavioral complications, including several alternative functional forms for mating efficiency and advective movements in which males actively seek out females. By calculating the fraction of females expected to go mateless as a joint function of reproductive asynchrony and patch size, we find that the populationâ€level reproductive rates necessary to offset female matelessness may be quite high. These results suggest that Allee effects engendered by reproductive asynchrony will be greatly exacerbated in spatially isolated populations.},

The model consisted of several substocks within a stock complex, each having its own stock and recruitment (S-R) relationship with Allee effects. Incorporation of Allee effects into the S-R relationship was achieved by specifying a critical spawning stock biomass threshold below which no recruitment occurred. The simulation model revealed that it was possible for the aggregate S-R relationship to appear compensatory, even though no substock exhibited this behavior. If the conclusions we draw from our modeling are correct, biological reference points developed from aggregated data from multiple substocks and used in conventional fisheries management and stock assessment models are likely to be inaccurate and possibly nonconservative.

On the other hand, in many marine species the genetically effective population size (N-e), which determines the genetic properties of a population, may be orders of magnitude smaller than the census population size (N). Here, microsatellite analyses of a time series of archived scales demonstrated a significant decline in genetic diversity in a New Zealand snapper population during its exploitation history. Effective population sizes estimated both from the decline in heterozygosity and from temporal fluctuations in allele frequency were five orders of magnitude smaller than census population sizes from fishery data.

	abstract = {The elasticities of long-run population growth rate with respect to vital rates are useful in studying selection on vital rates, and in evaluating management policy that aims to control vital rates. In temporally varying environments, elasticity is often calculated from simulations that assume a probability distribution for the environmental states. Here we develop a method to estimate elasticities directly from demographic data. Using a time-series of demographic matrices and age-structure we construct a consistent statistical estimator of elasticity that converges to the correct limiting value as the sample length increases. We also construct confidence intervals for elasticities from temporal data and suggest tools for testing hypotheses about the strength of selection. We use data on a natural population to show that our method can indeed accurately estimate elasticities using relatively short time series.},

	abstract = {Synchronic and allochronic data sets consisting of phenotypic values of various life-history traits from five grayling Thymallus thymallus populations with common ancestors were analysed for the purpose of estimating evolution and divergence rates. The synchronic data contained both juvenile and adult traits from populations that have been segregated for 44-88 years (9-22 generations). The allochronic time series contained growth- and maturation data spanning 95 years (16 generations). Estimated evolution and divergence rates were high compared with other life-history studies on the same temporal scale (0.002-1.008 haldanes, 10-30, 500 darwins). The divergence of adult traits were most probably caused by differential mortalities induced by variation in fishing intensity. For the population with allochronic data, 48 years (eight generations) of intense and consistent size-selective gill-net fishing resulted in a constant reduction in age (-0.33 years pr 10 year) and length (-18 mm pr 10 year) at maturity. Length-at-age for ages one to five also decreased during the same period. When gill-net fishing was relaxed, age and length at maturity and length-at-age increased. Divergence rates for juvenile traits derived from a common-garden experiment were high, and standardized selection differentials (s') were high, especially for yolk-sac volume (s' = 2.6). We also document that low divergence rates for juvenile traits were lower between populations having similar spawning/nursery habitats (running water) than populations having relatively different habitats (running water v.s. still water). We suggest that the major part of the observed phenotypic divergence is mostly due to adaptive evolution, although microsatellite data indicate that genetic drift also has occurred.},

	title = {Temporal and spatial genetic-structure of marine animal populations in the {California} current},
	abstract = {The hope that ''biotechnology'' will permit the identification of geographic sources of recruitment to most marine animal populations is not well supported either by logic or fact. First, population genetics tells us that dispersal among geographic populations is expected, at equilibrium, to eliminate the very molecular genetic differences that are supposed to permit identification of geographic provenance. Second, studies of allozymes and mitochondrial DNA have clearly shown that fish and invertebrate species with planktotrophic larvae are genetically quite similar over large regions, though not necessarily throughout their whole ranges. Genetic studies are, nevertheless, contributing new insights into the structure and biology of marine animal populations. One new insight is that sharp genetic subdivisions can occur in continuously distributed species, particularly those spanning biogeographic boundaries. An even more widespread observation is of very slight but significant microgeographic genetic heterogeneity embedded within broad regions of genetically very similar populations. Examples of the latter from the California Current are presented for the barnacle Balanus glandula and the northern anchovy Engraulis mordax. Microgeographic heterogeneity holds interest for biological oceanographers and fisheries scientists because it contradicts the logic of population genetics as well as commonly held notions about the structure of zooplankton populations. Evidence suggests that genetic heterogeneity on microgeographic scales results from temporal variation in the genetic composition of recruits. This temporal variation could be a consequence of either selection on larval populations or large variance in the reproductive success of individuals, owing to chance matching of reproductive activity with windows of oceanographic conditions conducive to fertilization, larval development, retention, and recruitment. In support of the latter hypothesis, effective sizes for natural oyster populations are estimated to be only small fractions of breeding population numbers. The temporal aspect of population genetic structure forges a strong interdisciplinary bridge to oceanographic research aimed at elucidating the temporally and spatially varying factors affecting recruitment.},

I compare the performance of different harvest strategies when evolutionary change is accounted for with the help of an age-structured population dynamics model. Assuming that age of first reproduction is the only evolving trait, harvesting of only mature individuals selects for delayed maturation and results in increased sustainable yields. Unselective harvesting of both mature and immature fish selects for earlier maturation which causes the sustainable yield to decrease. Constant stock size and constant harvest rate strategies perform equally well in terms of maximum sustainable yield, both before and after evolutionary change. The maximum sustainable yield for fixed-quota strategies is lower. All those strategies have similar evolutionary consequences given a similar average harvest rate. Coevolutionary dynamics between fish stock and the stock manager indicate that the evolutionary benefits of selective harvesting are attainable without incurring yield losses in the near future.},

The most important tool for recognizing and listing species as threatened is population viability analysis (PVA), which estimates the probability of extinction of a population or species over a specified time horizon. The most common PVA approach is to apply it to single time series of population abundance. This approach to population viability analysis ignores covariability of local populations. Covariability can be important because high synchrony of local populations reduces the effective number of local populations and leads to greater extinction risk. Needed is a way of extending PVA to model correlation structure among multiple local populations. Multivariate state-space modeling is applied to this problem and alternative estimation methods are compared. The multivariate state-space technique is applied to endangered populations of pacific salmon, USA. Simulations demonstrated that the correlation structure can strongly influence population viability and is best estimated using restricted maximum likelihood instead of maximum likelihood.

	abstract = {Forecasting population decline to a certain critical threshold (the quasi-extinction risk) is one of the central objectives of population viability analysis (PVA), and such predictions figure prominently in the decisions of major conservation organizations. In this paper, we argue that accurate forecasting of a population's quasi-extinction risk does not necessarily require knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms. Because of the stochastic and multiplicative nature of population growth, the ensemble behaviour of population trajectories converges to common statistical forms across a wide variety of stochastic population processes. This paper provides a theoretical basis for this argument. We show that the quasi-extinction surfaces of a variety of complex stochastic population processes (including age-structured, density-dependent and spatially structured populations) can be modelled by a simple stochastic approximation: the stochastic exponential growth process overlaid with Gaussian errors. Using simulated and real data, we show that this model can be estimated with 20-30 years of data and can provide relatively unbiased quasi-extinction risk with confidence intervals considerably smaller than (0,1). This was found to be true even for simulated data derived from some of the noisiest population processes (density-dependent feedback, species interactions and strong age-structure cycling). A key advantage of statistical models is that their parameters and the uncertainty of those parameters can be estimated from time series data using standard statistical methods. In contrast for most species of conservation concern, biologically realistic models must often be specified rather than estimated because of the limited data available for all the various parameters. Biologically realistic models will always have a prominent place in PVA for evaluating specific management options which affect a single segment of a population, a single demographic rate, or different geographic areas. However, for forecasting quasi-extinction risk, statistical models that are based on the convergent statistical properties of population processes offer many advantages over biologically realistic models.},

	abstract = {1. In the understorey herb Lathyrus vernus seed production is pollen limited, but increased reproduction results in a lower probability of remaining reproductive. Putting these two results together, previous research reported that population growth rate lambda was negatively impacted by high pollination. 2. Thus, costs and benefits have to be translated into the common currency of their respective effects on population dynamics to determine whether populations are truly pollen limited or whether they are already at an optimal level of pollination. 3. Also, when pollinators and demography vary from year to year we require a framework that examines reproductive benefits and demographic costs in the context of a variable environment. Whether or not additional pollination will increase the stochastic population growth rate lambda(S) depends upon the balance of stochastic elasticities of the costs and benefits. 4. In constant environment models, where seed survival, germination and seedling survival were increased, we found that the high cost of reproduction could be offset by improvements in seed survival and germination, but not by improvements of seedling survival. 5. In variable environment models, where changes in the sequence and frequencies of high- and low-pollination years mixed with occasional high-germination years were modelled, we found that increasing the frequency of high-germination conditions could offset the cost of reproduction, and the offset was even greater if high-germination years occurred after a high-pollination year or if high pollination was accompanied by high-germination conditions in the same year. 6. Both deterministic lambda and stochastic lambda(S) were less sensitive to perturbation of reproduction than to perturbation of the probability for flowering plants to remain reproductive. In other words, a small change in the parameter which is related to the `cost' of reproduction had a bigger effect than a small change in the parameter which is related to the `benefit' of increased pollination for Lathyrus. 7.Synthesis. Stochastic environment-specific elasticities for reproduction and stasis of flowering plants differ in their response to environmental context. The cost-benefit relationships, the ultimate fitness consequences of supplemental pollen, are influenced by the frequency and sequence of years differing in pollen availability and recruitment conditions.},

Here we demonstrate a useful method that circumvents data limitation and reduces sampling error by combining ecologically similar multispecies time series into one long time series. With this technique, individual ecological time series containing as few as 20 data points can be mined for such important information as ( 1) significantly improved forecast ability, ( 2) the presence and location of nonlinearity, and ( 3) the effective dimensionality ( the number of relevant variables) of an ecological system.},

Worries over sudden climate change and irreversible changes in ecosystems are rooted in the potential that nonlinear systems have for complex and 'pathological' behaviours(1,2). Nonlinear behaviours have been shown in model systems(3) and in some natural systems(1,4-8), but their occurrence in large-scale marine environments remains controversial(9,10). Here we show that time series observations of key physical variables(11-14) for the North Pacific Ocean that seem to show these behaviours are not deterministically nonlinear, and are best described as linear stochastic. In contrast, we find that time series for biological variables(5,15-17) having similar properties exhibit a low-dimensional nonlinear signature. To our knowledge, this is the first direct test for nonlinearity in large-scale physical and biological data for the marine environment. These results address a continuing debate over the origin of rapid shifts in certain key marine observations as coming from essentially stochastic processes or from dominant nonlinear mechanisms(1,9,10,18-20). Our measurements suggest that large-scale marine ecosystems are dynamically nonlinear, and as such have the capacity for dramatic change in response to stochastic fluctuations in basin-scale physical states.},

In the Northwest Atlantic, 30- to 40-year declines of more than 90{\textbackslash}\% of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) have been associated with significant reductions in age and length at maturity, changes most parsimoniously explained as genetic responses to fishing. Increased survival costs of reproduction associated with earlier maturity, resulting in higher natural mortality and shorter life span, negatively affect population growth rate and rate of recovery. Coupled with lower hatching rate among first-time spawners and smaller size at maturity, a modest reduction in age from 6 to 4 years can reduce annual population growth in Atlantic cod by 25{\textbackslash}\%-30{\textbackslash}\%, based on the output of a stochastic, age-structured life history model. Earlier maturity more than doubles the probability of negative population growth every generation. These results underscore the potential for fishing-induced changes to life history traits alone to generate slow or negligible recovery in marine fishes, exacerbating negative impacts on population growth resulting from ecosystem-level alterations to interspecific competition and predation.},

Individual heterogeneity in vital parameters, which may depend on age or stage, can alter many population characteristics compared with a homogeneous population, affecting both deterministic and stochastic properties of the population process. Demographic variance is an important parameter influenced by heterogeneity. However, whether heterogeneity leads to increased or decreased demographic variance has been an unresolved question, except for special cases. Here, we present a general stochastic matrix model for a heterogeneous population that allows us to examine effects of heterogeneity on population dynamics, even when the degree of heterogeneity depends on age. Using this model, we found that the demographic variance may increase, decrease, or remain unaltered compared with a homogeneous comparison model, depending on the vital parameter values and on how these are distributed among individuals at each time step. Furthermore, if the reproductive value is the same for all individuals, heterogeneity has no effect on the demographic variance. Thus, we provide a general theoretical framework for analyzing how individual heterogeneity caused by different biological mechanisms affects fluctuations of especially small populations.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17650247},
	abstract = {Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), a species can be listed if it is at risk "in all or a significant portion of its range," but the ESA provides no guidance on how to interpret this key phrase. We propose a simple test to determine whether the areas of a species' range in which it is currently at risk amount to a significant portion: If the species were to become extirpated from these areas, at that point would the entire species be at risk? If so, then these areas represent a significant portion of the species' range. By establishing the species itself as the point of reference for determining significance, this test directs attention to biological risk factors and avoids difficulties inherent in subjective evaluations of importance to humans. For broadly distributed species this framework could provide ESA protection due to cumulative risks before the entire species met the criteria to be considered threatened or endangered. This framework also allows a somewhat broader concept of range to include major components of diversity necessary for long-term persistence. The concept of a historical template (i.e., conditions under which the species was known to be viable) is important in providing a fixed reference point for evaluating viability. Empirical examples illustrate how these concepts have been applied in recent ESA listing determinations. Most ESA-listed units of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) can be divided into multiple strata that differ in terms of ecology, geology, or life-history traits of the component populations. The goal of ESA recovery planning is to restore viable populations in enough strata that the listed unit as a whole is no longer threatened or endangered in all or a significant portion of its range. In a recent review of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Puget Sound, current status (some populations increasing and others declining) was evaluated in the context of the historical template, and it was concluded that current patterns of distribution and abundance do not depart substantially from what would be expected at any point in time under natural conditions in a large metapopulation. The Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis) is ESA listed in the contiguous United States, where it occurs in four geographic areas. Populations in one region, the Northern Rockies/Cascades, have always been the most important for long-term persistence of the species in the United States. Because the other regions never contained more than limited amounts of good-quality lynx habitat, those areas are not considered to represent a significant portion of the species' range.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16629801},
	abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high ( approximately 100\%; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H(0): Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm {\textless} or = 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm {\textless} or = 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average.

Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context.

Because life-history traits are closely linked to the dynamics and productivity of fish populations, understanding and documenting the extent to which this expectation is borne out in reality is both scientifically and practically important. The primary empirical challenges are twofold: observing phenotypic change does not imply genetic change as life-history traits are phenotypically plastic, and fishing is but one potential driver of contemporary evolution. Here we focus on the first challenge by describing how to work toward disentangling genetic and plastic effects in the absence of genetic data. In particular, we explain how the consideration of maturation reaction norms helps to disentangle genetic and plastic changes in age and size at maturation. We first outline the logic and limitations of the maturation reaction-norm approach. We then review the most important statistical methods available for estimating maturation reaction norms from empirical data. For each of these methods, we discuss its domain of applicability together with its strengths and weaknesses.},

We performed an analysis of such trends across multiple studies, to test for the consistency of life history changes under ﬁshing, and for their association with the intensity of exploitation (ﬁshing mortality rate). We analyzed 143 time series from 37 commercial ﬁsh stocks, the majority of which originated from the North Atlantic. Rates of phenotypic change were calculated for two traditional maturation indices (length and age at 50\% maturity), as well as for probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). We found that all three indices declined in heavily exploited populations, and at a rate that was strongly correlated with the intensity of ﬁshing (for length at 50\% maturity and PMRNs). These results support previous assertions that ﬁshing pressure is playing a major role in the life history changes observed in commercial ﬁsh stocks. Rates of change were as strong for PMRNs as for age and size at 50\% maturity, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ﬁshing-induced phenotypic changes can sometimes have a genetic basis.},

	abstract = {Fisheries-induced evolution has been hypothesized to delay the recovery of collapsed ﬁsh stocks through effects on their productivity. The cod stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (SGSL) collapsed in the early 1990s and has shown no recovery since then, due mainly to high natural mortality of adult cod. Age and size at maturation of SGSL cod decreased sharply over time in cohorts produced in the 1950s and 1960s, likely reﬂecting an evolutionary response to intensiﬁed ﬁshing, and have remained low since then, despite severe reductions in ﬁshing mortality over the past 15 years. A predicted consequence of early maturation is increased natural mortality due to higher costs to reproduction. Early maturation may be a cause of increases in natural mortality of SGSL cod in the 1970s but does not appear to be related to the much larger increases since then. Instead, the current high natural mortality of SGSL cod appears to be primarily a cause, rather than a consequence, of the continued early maturation in this population, now replacing ﬁshing mortality as the agent of selection favouring early maturity. This striking example of the failure to reverse ﬁsheries-induced evolution by relaxing ﬁshing pressure emphasizes the need for management strategies that minimize the chances of harvestinduced genetic change.},

We investigate the roles of fishing regulation in comparison with ecosystem status for Baltic Sea cod stock productivity, growth performance, and population stability. This case study is interesting because three cod populations with different exploitation patterns and stock status are located in three adjacent but partially, ecologically different areas. In assessing stock status, growth, and productivity, we use survey information and rather basic stock parameters without relying on age readings. Because there is an urgent interest of better understanding of the current development of the Eastern Baltic cod stock, we argue that our approach represents partly a novel way of interpreting monitoring information together with catch data in a simplified yet more informative way. Our study reports how the Eastern and Western Baltic cod have gone toward more truncated size structures between 1991 and 2016, in particular for the Eastern Baltic cod, whereas the Öresund cod show no trend. We suggest that selective fishing may disrupt fish population dynamic stability and that lower natural productivity might amplify the effects of selective fishing. In support of earlier findings on a density-­dependent growth of Eastern Baltic cod, management is advised to acknowledge that sustainable exploitation levels for Eastern Baltic cod are much more limited than perceived in regular assessments. Of more general importance, our results emphasize the need to embrace a more realistic view on what ecosystems can produce regarding tractable fish biomass to facilitate a more ecosystem-­based fisheries management.},

	abstract = {The recovery of depleted species depends on their population dynamics at low abundance. Classical population growth models, applied widely in fisheries science, assume that per capita offspring production increases as abundance declines (compensation). However, slow or absent recovery by many depleted fishes might reflect unexpectedly weak compensation or the presence of Allee effects (depensation). Using meta-analytical techniques to describe reproductive dynamics, we find considerable variability among 207 exploited marine fish stocks (104 species) in how standardized per capita population growth changes with abundance. Although many species exhibit strong compensatory dynamics (negative density dependence), others show much weaker compensation than expected, and some exhibit evidence of an Allee effect, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Alaskan walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). As data at low levels of abundance become increasingly available, it appears that compensation, while strong in some species, is comparatively weak or nonexistent in others, thus providing an explanation for why the recovery of some depleted stocks, despite reductions in exploitation, has been considerably less than what classic models of population growth would otherwise suggest.},

	abstract = {Despite 2 decades of very low fishing levels, numerous NW Atlantic demersal fish stocks have failed to recover from collapsed states or are presently collapsing. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, adult natural mortality (M ) appears to be the demographic rate that most limits population productivity in at least 3 species: Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, white hake Urophycis tenuis and winter skate Leucoraja ocellata. The causes of elevated M are not well understood, though there is indirect evidence consistent with an effect of predation by grey seals Halichoerus grypus. However, direct evidence is lacking due to uncertainty in the seal diet. Consequently, Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken using data on the spatial overlap between the seals and the fishes and a seal food-consumption model, to estimate the plausibility that different seal-diet compositions could explain observed M levels. Under the simulation assumptions, we find that predation could explain up to 20 to 50\% of M in adult white hake and cod even if these species comprise a small percentage of grey seal diets ({\textless} 25\%). If seals consume some of these fish only partially, by selectively feeding on soft tissues, a predation effect becomes more plausible. Predation can also plausibly explain the observed elevated M in adult winter skate, even if they comprise a negligible ({\textless} 0.1\%) percentage of the grey seal diet. Though the simulations deal with the factors that shape the potential for predation, a greater understanding of prey selection is required to conclude whether grey seals are actually adversely impacting these fish populations.},

	abstract = {The interest in ﬁshing-induced life-history evolution has been growing in the last decade, in part because of the increasing number of studies suggesting evolutionary changes in life-history traits, and the potential ecological and economic consequences these changes may have. Among the traits that could evolve in response to ﬁshing, growth has lately received attention. However, critical reading of the literature on growth evolution in ﬁsh reveals conceptual confusion about the nature of ‘growth’ itself as an evolving trait, and about the different ways ﬁshing can affect growth and size-at-age of ﬁsh, both on ecological and on evolutionary time-scales. It is important to separate the advantages of being big and the costs of growing to a large size, particularly when studying life-history evolution. In this review, we explore the selection pressures on growth and the resultant evolution of growth from a mechanistic viewpoint. We deﬁne important concepts and outline the processes that must be accounted for before observed phenotypic changes can be ascribed to growth evolution. When listing traits that could be traded-off with growth rate, we group the mechanisms into those affecting resource acquisition and those governing resource allocation. We summarize potential effects of ﬁshing on traits related to growth and discuss methods for detecting evolution of growth. We also challenge the prevailing expectation that ﬁshing-induced evolution should always lead to slower growth.},

	abstract = {The value of big old fat fecund female ﬁsh (BOFFFFs) in fostering stock productivity and stability has long been underappreciated by conventional ﬁsheries science and management, although Hjort (1914) indirectly alluded to the importance of maternal effects. Compared with smaller mature females, BOFFFFs in a broad variety of marine and freshwater teleosts produce far more and often larger eggs that may develop into larvae that grow faster and withstand starvation better. As (if not more) importantly, BOFFFFs in batch-spawning species tend to have earlier and longer spawning seasons and may spawn in different locations than smaller females. Such features indicate that BOFFFFs are major agents of bet-hedging strategies that help to ensure individual reproductive success in environments that vary tremendously in time and space. Even if all else were equal, BOFFFFs can outlive periods that are unfavourable for successful reproduction and be ready to spawn profusely and enhance recruitment when favourable conditions return (the storage effect). Fishing differentially removes BOFFFFs, typically resulting in severe truncation of the size and age structure of the population. In the worst cases, ﬁshing mortality acts as a powerful selective agent that inhibits reversal of size and age truncation, even if ﬁshing intensity is later reduced. Age truncation is now known to destabilize ﬁshed populations, increasing their susceptibility to collapse. Although some ﬁsheries models are beginning to incorporate maternal and other old-growth effects, most continue to treat all spawning-stock biomass as identical: many small young females are assumed to contribute the same to stock productivity as an equivalent mass of BOFFFFs. A growing body of knowledge dictates that ﬁsheries productivity and stability would be enhanced if management conserved old-growth age structure in ﬁshed stocks, be it by limiting exploitation rates, by implementing slot limits, or by establishing marine reserves, which are now known to seed surrounding ﬁshed areas via larval dispersal. Networks of marine reserves are likely to be the most effective means of ensuring that pockets of old-growth age structure survive throughout the geographic range of demersal species.},

Adult growth rate was constant, except during a period of increased population abundance when somatic growth decreased. Both length (Lma{\textasciitilde}and age at first sexual maturity decreased since 1900. No firm evidence was obtained for a change in total reproductive investment, although size-specific fecundity was reduced in the period of increased population abundance, suggesting a trade-off between egg numbers and egg size. Analysis of the phenotypic response of maturation to an increase in juvenile growth suggested that only a part of the decrease in Lmat could be ascribed to the observed increase in juvenile growth. The unexplained part of the change in Lmat corresponded with the predicted change due to genetical selection by the fisheries. This supported the hypothesis that fishing caused a genetical change in L{\textasciitilde}at, although an unequivocal interpretation is not possible from a descriptive study.},

Survival is sensibly modeled as a binomial process, but annual reproductive success (ARS) is more complex and general models for demographic stochasticity do not exist. Here we introduce a stochastic model framework for ARS and illustrate some of its properties. We model a sequence of stochastic events: nest completion, the number of eggs or neonates produced, nest predation, and the survival of individual offspring to independence. We also allow multiple nesting attempts within a breeding season. Most of these components can be described by Bernoulli or binomial processes; the exception is the distribution of offspring number. Using clutch and litter size distributions from 53 vertebrate species, we demonstrate that amongâ€individual variability in offspring number can usually be described by the generalized Poisson distribution. Our model framework allows the demographic variance to be calculated from underlying biological processes and can easily be linked to models of environmental stochasticity or selection because of its parametric structure. In addition, it reveals that the distributions of ARS are often multimodal and skewed, with implications for extinction risk and evolution in small populations.},

	title = {Climate variability, fish, and fisheries},
	abstract = {Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of ``unexpected'' events-that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic-on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily. decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.},

This prediction has been tested by looking for a negative correlation between the sensitivities (or elasticities) of the elements in a projection matrix and their variances (or coefficients of variation). Here, we show by constructing random matrices that a spurious negative correlation exists between the sensitivities and variances, and between the elasticities and coefficients of variation, of matrix elements. This spurious correlation arises in part because size transition probabilities, which are bounded by 0 and 1, have a limit to their variability that often does not apply to matrix elements representing reproduction. We advocate an alternative analysis based on the underlying vital rates (not the matrix elements) that accounts for the inherent limit to the variability of zeroâ€toâ€one vital rates, corrects for sampling variation, and tests for a declining upper limit to variability as a vital rateâ€™s fitness contribution increases. Applying this analysis to demographic data from five populations of the alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis, we provide evidence of stronger buffering in the vital rates that most influence fitness.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems can alternate suddenly between contrasting persistent states due to internal processes or external drivers. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which these shifts occur, especially in exploited ecosystems. There have been several abrupt marine ecosystem shifts attributed either to fishing, recent climate change or a combination of these two drivers. We show that temperature has been an important driver of the trophodynamics of the North Sea, a heavily fished marine ecosystem, for nearly 50 years and that a recent pronounced change in temperature established a new ecosystem dynamic regime through a series of internal mechanisms. Using an end-to-end ecosystem approach that included primary producers, primary, secondary and tertiary consumers, and detritivores, we found that temperature modified the relationships among species through nonlinearities in the ecosystem involving ecological thresholds and trophic amplifications. Trophic amplification provides an alternative mechanism to positive feedback to drive an ecosystem towards a new dynamic regime, which in this case favours jellyfish in the plankton and decapods and detritivores in the benthos. Although overfishing is often held responsible for marine ecosystem degeneration, temperature can clearly bring about similar effects. Our results are relevant to ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), seen as the way forward to manage exploited marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Generalized additive mixed models are proposed for overdispersed and correlated data, which arise frequently in studies involving clustered, hierarchical and spatial designs. This class of models allows flexible functional dependence of an outcome variable on covariates by using nonparametric regression, while accounting for correlation between observations by using random effects. We estimate nonparametric functions by using smoothing splines and jointly estimate smoothing parameters and variance components by using marginal quasi-likelihood. Because numerical integration is often required by maximizing the objective functions, double penalized quasi-likelihood is proposed to make approximate inference. Frequentist and Bayesian inferences are compared. A key feature of the method proposed is that it allows us to make systematic inference on all model components within a unified parametric mixed model framework and can be easily implemented by fitting a working generalized linear mixed model by using existing statistical software. A bias correction procedure is also proposed to improve the performance of double penalized quasi-likelihood for sparse data. We illustrate the method with an application to infectious disease data and we evaluate its performance through simulation.},

We further show that large-scale climatic patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and, to a lesser degree, Arctic Oscillation (AO)) are strongly related to the observed MPB synchrony, and that they probably operate through controlling the frequency of extreme cold winter temperatures that affect MPB larvae survival. A smaller portion of the data's variability is linked to the onset of the two largest outbreaks in the studied period and might be attributed to dispersal from outbreak-prone areas or else to differences in microhabitat (e. g., host availability) in these regions. The onset of a warm PDO phase in 1976 favored MPB outbreaks by reducing the occurrence of extremely low winter temperatures province-wide. Likewise, the exceptionally high and persistent AO values of the late 1980s and 1990s enhanced MPB activity in the southern and northern parts of the region. Summer warmth cannot be discarded as an important agent at smaller scales.},

Meanwhile, our understanding of the limits of plasticity, and how they may be underlain by the costs of plasticity, is still in its infancy.

	abstract = {Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, `pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as `replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as `treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change.},

We also show that this rise in biodiversity paralleled a decrease in the mean size of zooplanktonic copepods and that the reorganization of the planktonic ecosystem toward dominance by smaller organisms may influence the networks in which carbon flows, with negative effects on the downward biological carbon pump and demersal Atlantic cod (). Our study suggests that, contrary to the usual interpretation of increasing biodiversity being a positive emergent property promoting the stability/resilience of ecosystems, the parallel decrease in sizes of planktonic organisms could be viewed in the North Atlantic as reducing some of the services provided by marine ecosystems to humans.},

We tested this hypothesis by quantifying natural selection and harvest selection acting on a freshwater fish (pike) over four decades. Across the time series, directional natural selection tended to favour large individuals whereas the fishery targeted large individuals. Moreover, non-linear natural selection tended to favour intermediate sized fish whereas the fishery targeted intermediate sized fish because the smallest and largest individuals were often not captured. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that natural selection and fishery selection often acted in opposite directions within this natural system. Moreover, the two selective factors combined to produce reduced fitness overall and stronger stabilizing selection relative to natural selection acting alone. The long-term ramifications of such human-induced modifications to adaptive landscapes are currently unknown and certainly warrant further investigation.},

Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses decompose treatment effects on a dependent variable (usually, but not necessarily, population growth rate) into contributions from differences in the parameters that determine that variable. 2. Fixed, random and regression LTRE designs have been applied to plant populations in many contexts. These designs all make use of the derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the parameters, and describe differences as sums of linear approximations. 3. Here, I extend LTRE methods to analyse treatment effects on the stochastic growth rate log lambda(s). The problem is challenging because a stochastic model contains two layers of dynamics: the stochastic dynamics of the environment and the response of the vital rates to the state of the environment. I consider the widely used case where the environment is described by a Markov chain. 4. As the parameters describing the environmental Markov chain do not appear explicitly in the calculation of log lambda(s), derivatives cannot be calculated. The solution presented here combines derivatives for the vital rates with an alternative (and older) approach, due to Kitagawa and Keyfitz, that calculates contributions in a way analogous to the calculation of main effects in statistical models. 5. The resulting LTRE analysis decomposes log lambda(s) into contributions from differences in: (i) the stationary distribution of environmental states, (ii) the autocorrelation pattern of the environment, and (iii) the stage-specific vital rate responses within each environmental state. 6. As an example, the methods are applied to a stage-classified model of the prairie plant Lomatium bradshawii in a stochastic fire environment. 7. Synthesis. The stochastic growth rate is an important parameter describing the effects of environmental fluctuations on population viability. Like any growth rate, it responds to differences in environmental factors. Without a decomposition analysis there is no way to attribute differences in the stochastic growth rate to particular parts of the life cycle or particular aspects of the stochastic environment. The methods presented here provide such an analysis, extending the LTRE analyses already available for deterministic environments.},

At the species level, egg sizes in 309 North Atlantic fishes range from 0.3 to 18.0 mm diameter (median = 1.1), size at hatching varies directly with egg size, and large adult size is associated with large eggs but the relationship is weak. Within populations, egg sizes are distributed normally with a median coefficient of variation of 4{\textbackslash}\% (n = 56 species). Egg size varied among females in all cases for which female-level data were found. Estimates of the variance components of egg size due to females were found for three species and, as a percentage of total variance, are 71{\textbackslash}\% for capelin, Mallotus villosus, 46{\textbackslash}\% for winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus, and 35{\textbackslash}\% for Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. For cod, which spawn multiple egg batches per year, an additional batches-within-females component was estimated to be 26{\textbackslash}\%. Size at hatching also differs among sibgroups and is generally directly related to egg size at the individual level. We modelled fish growth by allowing individuals to grow at exponential rates from a normal distribution of initial sizes. Comparing size variation in model fish to empirical evidence suggests that variation in initial sizes, propagated by growth, could account for a large fraction of the size variation observed months after hatching in natural populations. We view size variation in young marine fishes to be largely of maternal origin and environmentally modulated, which if true has special consequences for fisheries and aquaculture.},

Two non-exclusive hypotheses that may account for the maturity changes are (1) the `compensatory response' hypothesis, predicting that reduced stock size resulting from exploitation leads to faster growth and hence earlier maturity as a phenotypically plastic response to environmental change; and (2) the `evolutionary response' hypothesis, predicting that intensive exploitation causes selection for early maturation, since few late-maturing phenotypes survive until first spawning. Trends in length-at-age suggest a strong compensatory response, but leave the possibility of evolutionary change unaddressed. In order to disentangle phenotypic and possible genetic changes in maturation, we examined the reaction norm for age and size at maturation to see if any changes had occurred. This reaction norm describes the probabilities of maturing at each relevant age and size. We found small but statistically significant changes in maturation reaction norms; these changes were restricted to 2 out of 6 of the maturation ages. This confirms that growth-related phenotypic plasticity has largely been responsible for the documented changes in maturity, and suggests at most a weak evolutionary response. This is in line with theoretical expectations from the dominating fishing pattern, where pure schools of only mature or only early immature fish were targeted, rather than a fishery on both immature and mature fish simultaneously, as has been the case in stocks of cod Gadus morhua and plaice Pleuronectes platessa, where significant evolutionary responses have been found.},

	abstract = {Recently, the importance of the female to population dynamics-especially her non-genetic contribution to offspring fitness or maternal effect-has received much attention in studies of a diverse collection of animal and plant taxa. Of particular interest to fisheries scientists and managers is the role of the demographic structure of the adult component of fish populations in the formation of future year classes. Traditionally, fisheries managers tended to assess whole populations without regard to variation between the individuals within the population. In doing so, they overlooked the variation in spawning production between individual females as a source of variation to recruitment magnitude and fluctuation. Indeed, intensive and/or selective harvesting of larger and older females, those that may produce more-and higher quality-offspring, has been implicated in the collapse of a number of important fish stocks. In a fisheries resource management context, whether capture fisheries or aquaculture, female demographics and inter-female differences warrant serious consideration in developing harvesting and breeding strategies, and in understanding general population dynamics. Here I review the range of female traits and environmental conditions females encounter which may influence the number or quality of their offspring via a maternal effect.},

	url = {10.1086/648604},
	abstract = {Abstract: Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a method for obtaining point estimates of a random effect in a mixed effect model. Over the past decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary change, spatialâ€genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation and example why BLUP often gives anticonservative and biased estimates of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with BLUP methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because BLUPs are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases, predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that BLUPs are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to longâ€term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not supported.},

For the conservation manager, they are an opportunity to concentrate effort and resources on protecting marine wildlife and habitats. Action taken at these sites also makes a contribution to wider conservation efforts. Two very different examples of this are their potential as a reservoir for species which can seed other areas, and as a good base for marine education programmes.

	abstract = {1. All reserve designs must be guided by an understanding of natural history and habitat variability. 2. Differences in scale and predictability set aside highly dynamic pelagic systems from terrestrial and nearshore ecosystems, where wildlife reserves were first implemented. Yet, as in static systems, many pelagic species use predictable habitats to breed and forage. Marine protected areas (MPAs) could be designed to protect these foraging and breeding aggregations. 3. Understanding the physical mechanisms that influence the formation and persistence of these aggregations is essential in order to define and implement pelagic protected areas. We classify pelagic habitats according to their dynamics and predictability into three categories: static, persistent and ephemeral features. 4. While traditional designs are effective in static habitats, many important pelagic habitats are neither fixed nor predictable. Thus, pelagic protected areas will require dynamic boundaries and extensive buffers. 5. In addition, the protection of far-ranging pelagic vertebrates will require dynamic MPAs defined by the extent and location of large-scale oceanographic features. 6. Recent technological advances and our ability to implement large-scale conservation actions will facilitate the implementation of pelagic protected areas. 7. The establishment of pelagic MPAs should include enforcement, research and monitoring programmes to evaluate design effectiveness. 8. Ultimately, society will need a holistic management scheme for entire ocean basins. Such overarching management will rely on many innovative tools, including the judicious use of pelagic MPAs.

MPAs are often used in an effort to conserve biodiversity and manage fisheries stocks. However, their efficacy and effect on fisheries yields remain unclear. We conducted a case-study on the economic impact of different MPA network design strategies on the Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua) fisheries in Canada. The open-source R toolbox that we developed to analyze this case study can be customized to conduct similar analyses for other systems. We used a spatially-explicit individual-based model of population growth and dispersal coupled with a fisheries management and harvesting component. We found that MPA networks that both protect the target species' habitat (particularly the spawning grounds), and were spatially optimized to improve population connectivity had the highest net present value (i.e., were most profitable for the fishing industry). These higher profits were achieved primarily by reducing the distance travelled for fishing and reducing the probability of a moratorium event. These findings add to a growing body of knowledge demonstrating the importance of incorporating population connectivity in the MPA planning process, as well as the ability of this R toolbox to explore ecological and economic consequences of alternative MPA network designs.},

Based on a survey of recent literature, we synthesize information on such taboos. We refer to them as "resource and habitat taboos" (RHTs). Examples are grouped in six different categories depending on their potential nature conservation and management functions. We compare RHTs with contemporary measures of conservation and identify and discuss some key benefits that may render them useful in partnership designs for conservation and management. We conclude that many RHTs have functions similar to those of formal institutions for nature conservation in contemporary society but have not been sufficiently recognized in this capacity. We suggest that designs for conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use in developing countries focus more on informal institutions, like social taboos, because they may offer several advantages compared to conventional measures.

Here, we synthesize the literature on the customary management of coral reefs emerging from diverse disciplines including anthropology, common property economics, and ecology. First, we review various customary management strategies and draw parallels with Western fisheries management. Secondly, we examine customary resource management and conservation. We argue that, while resource conservation often appears to be an unintended by-product of other social processes, customary management can, in fact, conserve marine resources. In the third section, we examine the resilience of customary management institutions to socioeconomic transformations. We suggest that in conditions of high population and commercialization of marine resources, property rights may become strengthened but arrangements that rely on self-restraint become weakened. Finally, we examine the commensurability of customary management and conservation. We emphasize that practical and conceptual differences exist between customary management and contemporary conservation which have often led to failed attempts to hybridize these systems. However, when these differences are understood and acknowledged there exists a potential to develop adaptive management systems that are: (1) highly flexible; (2) able to conserve resources, and; (3) able to meet community goals. In each section, we provide research priorities. We conclude by developing six key features of successful hybrid management systems.},

	abstract = {The incidental capture of non-target species fromprawn trawling has recently attracted worldwide attention. Primarily, concerns arisefrom the perception that prawn trawls catch anddiscard large numbers of juveniles of species that,when larger, are targeted in other commercial andrecreational fisheries. While several managementoptions are available, the majority of fisheries inthe world have attempted to address this issue throughphysical modifications to trawls, designed to improveselectivity. The types of modifications used reflectfishery-specific characteristics; however, mostcan be broadly classified into twocategories, including: (1) those that separate speciesby differences in behaviour; and (2) those thatmechanically exclude unwanted organisms according totheir size. In the present paper, I provide achronological review of publications in the primaryliterature that describe experiments examiningmodifications within these categories. This reviewshows that inherent variabilities among differentfisheries greatly influence the types of designs thatneed to be applied and although some designs have thepotential for application across different fisheries,significant modification and re-evaluation are oftenrequired. By collating information from previousstudies, I also propose a framework encompassingthe various stages involved in developing and applyingsuccessful modifications in prawn-trawl fisheries. The key stages identified include: (1) quantificationof bycatches and accumulation of fishery-relatedinformation; (2) examination and re-evaluation ofmodifications; (3) assessment of damage inflicted onescaping individuals; and (4) promotion of recommendeddesigns.},

	abstract = {Marine fish and invertebrates are shifting their regional and global distributions in response to climate change, but it is unclear whether their productivity is being affected as well. Here we tested for time-varying trends in biological productivity parameters across 262 fish stocks of 127 species in 39 large marine ecosystems and high-seas areas (hereafter LMEs). This global meta-analysis revealed widespread changes in the relationship between spawning stock size and the production of juvenile offspring (recruitment), suggesting fundamental biological change in fish stock productivity at early life stages. Across regions, we estimate that average recruitment capacity has declined at a rate approximately equal to 3\% of the historical maximum per decade. However, we observed large variability among stocks and regions; for example, highly negative trends in the North Atlantic contrast with more neutral patterns in the North Pacific. The extent of biological change in each LME was significantly related to observed changes in phytoplankton chlorophyll concentration and the intensity of historical overfishing in that ecosystem. We conclude that both environmental changes and chronic overfishing have already affected the productive capacity of many stocks at the recruitment stage of the life cycle. These results provide a baseline for ecosystem-based fisheries management and may help adjust expectations for future food production from the oceans.},

	abstract = {Marine phytoplankton account for approximately half of the production of organic matter on earth, support virtually all marine ecosystems, constrain fisheries yields, and influence climate and weather. Despite this importance, long-term trajectories of phytoplankton abundance or biomass are difficult to estimate, and the extent of changes is unresolved. Here, we use a new, publicly-available database of historical shipboard oceanographic measurements to estimate long-term changes in chlorophyll concentration (Chl; a widely used proxy for phytoplankton biomass) from 1890 to 2010. This work builds upon an earlier analysis (Boyce et al., 2010) by taking published criticisms into account, and by using recalibrated data, and novel analysis methods. Rates of long-term chlorophyll change were estimated using generalized additive models within a multi-model inference framework, and post hoc sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of results. Our analysis revealed statistically significant Chl declines over 62\% of the global ocean surface area where data were present, and in 8 of 11 large ocean regions. While Chl increases have occurred in many locations, weighted syntheses of local- and regional-scale estimates confirmed that average chlorophyll concentrations have declined across the majority of the global ocean area over the past century. Sensitivity analyses indicate that these changes do not arise from any bias between data types, nor do they depend upon the method of spatial or temporal aggregation, nor the use of a particular statistical model. The wider consequences of this long-term decline of marine phytoplankton are presently unresolved, but will need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystem structure, geochemical cycling, and fishery yields.},

With today’s, growing emphasis on stock assessment, this symposium was a timely reminder of the need to identify fish stocks accurately, and the implications of stock identification for fisheries management. The symposium was structured into four general themes: (1) the stock concept; (2) genetic variation; (3) phenotypic variation; and (4) fisheries management. We review the presentations given in each theme session, which form the basis of the proceedings presented in this issue, as well as providing an overview of current issues and directions in stock identification research.

Numerous scientific and popular articles have pointed to the failures of fisheries management that have caused this crisis. These are widely accepted to be overcapacity in fishing fleets, a failure to take the ecosystem effects of fishing into account, and a failure to enforce unpalatable but necessary reductions in fishing effort on fishing fleets and communities. However, the claims of some analysts that there is an inevitable decline in the status of fisheries is, we believe, incorrect. There have been successes in fisheries management, and we argue that the tools for appropriate management exist. Unfortunately, they have not been implemented widely. Our analysis suggests that management authorities need to develop legally enforceable and tested harvest strategies, coupled with appropriate rights-based incentives to the fishing community, for the future of fisheries to be better than their past.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, existing approaches were expanded upon, aiming for a realistic consideration of cumulative impacts at a regional scale. Thirty-eight human activities were considered, with each broken down according to stressor types and a range of spatial influences. To add to the policy relevance, existing stressors within and outside of conservation areas were compared. Results indicate the entire continental shelf of Canada's Pacific marine waters is affected by multiple human activities at some level. Commercial fishing, land-based activities and marine transportation accounted for 57.0\%, 19.1\%, and 17.7\% of total cumulative impacts, respectively. Surprisingly, most areas with conservation designations contained higher impact scores than the mean values of their corresponding ecoregions. Despite recent advances in mapping cumulative impacts, many limitations remain. Nonetheless, preliminary analyses such as these can provide information relevant to precautionary management and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {1. Spatial management measures, such as time–area closures, offer a widely advocated strategy for managing bycatch in fisheries and fisheries that impact particular life-history stages, like spawning. The effectiveness of proposed management strategies can be evaluated across different policy dimensions of which we focus on one – maximising total profit. We examine whether a time–area closure presents an economically efficient means to manage bycatches of Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus on their spawning ground in the Gulf of Mexico by longline fishermen targeting yellowfin tuna T. albacares. 2. We combine a behavioural representation of bluefin migration with population dynamic models for the two species and an economic representation of relevant fisheries and solve for optimal, equilibrial management strategies. 3. The models predict the western Atlantic bluefin population is close to open access harvesting conditions, and that rebuilding the bluefin population would increase overall economic revenues from the fisheries by 460\%, regardless of the specific actions taken in the Gulf. 4. Time–area closures in the Gulf are predicted to be economically costly if there is little scope for recovery of the bluefin stock. However, the models predict such closures would offer limited economic benefits if there were a broader commitment to rebuild the bluefin population. 5. Synthesis and applications. Technological advances and improvements in our understanding of the life history of these and other species make increasingly precise spatial effort control possible in many fisheries. The case study illustrates when such management measures would maximise fisheries profits while accounting for population dynamics and differences in mortality from different fisheries. However, the case study also highlights that the more elementary policy challenge of preventing overfishing has still often to be overcome.},

	abstract = {1. While conservationists, resource managers, scientists and coastal planners have recognized the broad applicability of marine protected areas (MPAs), they are often implemented without a firm understanding of the conservation science — both ecological and socio-economic — underlying marine protection. The rush to implement MPAs has set the stage for paradoxical differences of opinions in the marine conservation community. 2. The enthusiastic prescription of simplistic solutions to marine conservation problems risks polarization of interests and ultimately threatens bona fide progress in marine conservation. The blanket assignment and advocacy of empirically unsubstantiated rules of thumb in marine protection creates potentially dangerous targets for conservation science. 3. Clarity of definition, systematic testing of assumptions, and adaptive application of diverse MPA management approaches are needed so that the appropriate mix of various management tools can be utilized, depending upon specific goals and conditions. Scientists have a professional and ethical duty to map out those paths that are most likely to lead to improved resource management and understanding of the natural world, including the human element, whether or not they are convenient, politically correct or publicly magnetic. 4. The use of MPAs as a vehicle for promoting long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity is in need of focus, and both philosophical and applied tune ups. A new paradigm arising out of integrated, multi-disciplinary science, management and education/outreach efforts must be adopted to help promote flexible, diverse and effective MPA management strategies. Given scientific uncertainties, MPAs should be designed so one can learn from their application and adjust their management strategies as needed, in the true spirit of adaptive management. 5. It is critical for the conservation community to examine why honest differences of opinion regarding MPAs have emerged, and recognize that inflexible attitudes and positions are potentially dangerous. We therefore discuss several questions — heretofore taken as implicit assumptions: (a) what are MPAs, (b) what purpose do MPAs serve, (c) are no-take MPAs the only legitimate MPAs, (d) should a single closed area target be set for all MPAs, and (e) how should policymakers and conservation communities deal with scientific uncertainty?

Although the scientific literature outlines specific ecological and social principles of EBM, we find that these details are only loosely incorporated into management plans and actions. Our results indicate that some principles of EBM are being put into practice, but the gap between the scientific literature and management plans suggests that these concepts need to be more effectively translated. Our results also reveal a need for operational tools to make scientific principles easier to put into practice, to further the implementation of EBM.},

We demonstrate the differences between the models through examples of their response to fishing and their dynamic behavior.

Only one of these segments managed to maintain the same level of turnover during the anchovy closure, while the others could not reach a minimum level of adaptability.

Catch rates were higher near the reserve (by a factor of 1.1 to 2.0), but fishing effort was often lowest there. Higher catch rates near the reserve were more likely due to spillover than to low fishing intensity. Lower fishing effort near the reserve may have been due to 1) weather patterns, 2) traditional importance of other fishing grounds, 3) high variability in catch rates, 4) lower market value of target species, and 5) social pressures. The yield taken near the reserve was only 10\% of the total yield, but the actual spillover contribution was probably much less than this.

	abstract = {This contribution, which reviews some broad trends in human history and in the history of fishing, argues that sustainability, however defined, rarely if ever occurred as a result of an explicit policy, but as result of our inability to access a major part of exploited stocks. With the development of industrial fishing, and the resulting invasion of the refuges previously provided by distance and depth, our interactions with fisheries resources have come to resemble the wars of extermination that newly arrived hunters conducted 40 000–50 000 years ago in Australia, and 12 000–13 000 years ago against large terrestrial mammals in North America. These broad trends are documented here through a map of change in fish sizes, which displays characteristic declines, first in the nearshore waters of industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere, then spread offshore and to the Southern Hemisphere. This geographical extension met its natural limit in the late 1980s, when the catches from newly accessed stocks ceased to compensate for the collapse in areas accessed earlier, hence leading to a gradual decline of global landing. These trends affect developing countries more than the developed world, which have been able to meet the shortfall by increasing imports from developing countries. These trends, however, together with the rapid growth of farming of carnivorous fishes, which consumes other fishes suited for human consumption, have led to serious food security issues. This promotes urgency to the implementation of the remedies traditionally proposed to alleviate overfishing (reduction of overcapacity, enforcement of conservative total allowable catches, etc.), and to the implementation of non-conventional approaches, notably the re-establishment of the refuges (also known as marine reserves), which made possible the apparent sustainability of pre-industrial fisheries.},

	abstract = {Fisheries management is the set of science-based procedures used by government institutions to regulate fishers' access to fisheries resources; this involves temporal and spatial restrictions on the deployment of fishing gear, restrictions on features of these gear and constraints on the species and size composition of the catch, and its overall magnitude. The traditional goal of fisheries management was to achieve maximum sustainable yields. Maximum economic yields are obtained with slightly lower catches from larger fish stocks. Modern fisheries management aims for minimising the impact of fishing on the ecosystem and considers trophic interactions when determining catch levels. A new challenge is the assessment and management of data-limited fish stocks, which constitute about three-fourth of the exploited stocks. Key Concepts: Fish stocks must be maintained above levels that allow them to produce the maximum sustainable yield. Mortality caused by fishing may not exceed the rate of mortality from natural causes such as predation, diseases or old age. The size at first capture must be chosen such that fish can realise their potential for growth and reproduction. Species with important ecosystem functions, such as forage fish, must be fished less. Government subsidies to fisheries, by reducing the cost of fishing, allows fishing to continue even when fish stocks are depleted; reducing subsides to fisheries thus contributes to fishery sustainability. Aquaculture can contribute to the global fish supply, but not when carnivorous fish are farmed, as they consume more fish than they produce.},

	abstract = {Marine reserves are a promising tool for fisheries management and conservation of biodiversity, but they are not a panacea for fisheries management problems. For fisheries that target highly mobile single species with little or no by-catch or habitat impact, marine reserves provide few benefits compared to conventional fishery management tools. For fisheries that are multi-species or on more sedentary stocks, or for which broader ecological impacts of fishing are an issue, marine reserves have some potential advantages. Their successful use requires a case-by-case understanding of the spatial structure of impacted fisheries, ecosystems and human communities. Marine reserves, together with other fishery management tools, can help achieve broad fishery and biodiversity objectives, but their use will require careful planning and evaluation. Mistakes will be made, and without planning, monitoring and evaluation, we will not learn what worked, what did not, and why. If marine reserves are implemented without case by case evaluation and appropriate monitoring programs, there is a risk of unfulfilled expectations, the creation of disincentives, and a loss of credibility of what potentially is a valuable management tool.},

We ask whether evidence of a species' interactions be detected and understood from patterns in the dynamics of that species alone. Theory predicts that strong coupling between a prey and a specialist predator/parasite should lead to an increase in the dimensionality of the prey's dynamics, whereas weak coupling should not. Here we describe a rare test of this prediction. Two natural enemies were added separately to replicate populations of a moth. For biological reasons that we identify here, the prediction of increased dimensionality was confirmed when a parasitoid wasp was added (although this increase had subtleties not previously appreciated), but the prediction failed for an added virus. Thus, an imprint of the interactions may be discerned within time-series data from component species of a system.},

	volume = {22},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18402584},
	abstract = {In recent centuries bird species have been deteriorating in status and becoming extinct at a rate that may be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than in prehuman times. We examined extinction rates of bird species designated critically endangered in 1994 and the rate at which species have moved through the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List categories of extinction risk globally for the period 1988-2004 and regionally in Australia from 1750 to 2000. For Australia we drew on historical accounts of the extent and condition of species habitats, spread of invasive species, and changes in sighting frequencies. These data sets permitted comparison of observed rates of movement through the IUCN Red List categories with novel predictions based on the IUCN Red List criterion E, which relates to explicit extinction probabilities determined, for example, by population viability analysis. The comparison also tested whether species listed on the basis of other criteria face a similar probability of moving to a higher threat category as those listed under criterion E. For the rate at which species moved from vulnerable to endangered, there was a good match between observations and predictions, both worldwide and in Australia. Nevertheless, species have become extinct at a rate that, although historically high, is 2 (Australia) to 10 (globally) times lower than predicted. Although the extinction probability associated with the critically endangered category may be too high, the shortfall in realized extinctions can also be attributed to the beneficial impact of conservation intervention. These efforts may have reduced the number of global extinctions from 19 to 3 and substantially slowed the extinction trajectory of 33 additional critically endangered species. Our results suggest that current conservation action benefits species on the brink of extinction, but is less targeted at or has less effect on moderately threatened species.},

Just as perturbation analysis (sensitivity and elasticity) of the asymptotic growth rate reveals the effects of the vital rates on long-term growth, the perturbation analysis of transient dynamics can reveal the determinants of short-term patterns. In this article, I present a completely new approach to transient sensitivity and elasticity analysis, using methods from matrix calculus. Unlike previous methods, this approach applies not only to linear time-invariant models but also to time-varying, subsidized, stochastic, nonlinear and spatial models. It is computationally simple, and does not require calculation of eigenvalues or eigenvectors. The method is presented along with applications to plant and animal populations.},

With no environmental autocorrelation, the dynamics of total population size, N, generally shows time lags and autocorrelation caused by life history, which may strongly bias estimates of environmental variance obtained by ignoring age structure. In contrast, the total reproductive value, V, is Markovian and obeys a first-order autoregressive process. This suggests a simple method for estimating the environmental variance, and avoiding potentially large bias due to age-structure fluctuations, by converting a multivariate time series of age structure to a univariate time series of In V. We illustrate the method by estimating the long-run growth rate and the environmental variance in an exponentially growing population of Bighorn Sheep. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a preliminary analysis of listing decisions under Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA), Mooers et al. (2007)demonstrated an apparent bias against marine and northern species. As a follow-up, we expanded the set of potential explanatory variables, including information on jurisdictional and administrative elements of the listing process, and considered an additional 16 species recommended for listing by SARA's scientific advisory committee as of 15 August 2006. Logistic model selection based on Akaike differences suggested that species were less likely to be listed if they were harvested or had commercial or subsistence harvesting as an explicitly identified threat; had Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) as a responsible authority (RA); were located in Canada's north generally, and especially in Nunavut; or were found mostly or entirely within Canada. Subsequent model validation with an independent set of 50 species for which a listing decision was handed down in December 2007 showed an overall misclassification rate of {\textless}0.10, indicating reasonable predictive power. In light of these results, we recommend that RAs under SARA adopt a two-track listing approach to address problems of delays arising from extended consultations and the inconsistent use by the RAs of socioeconomic analysis; consider revising SARA so that socioeconomic analysis occurs during decisions about protecting species and their habitats rather than at the listing stage; and maintain an integrated database with information on species' biology, threats, and agency actions to enable future evaluation of SARA's impact.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic die-offs can have important consequences for vertebrate population growth and biodiversity, but catastrophic risks are not commonly incorporated into endangered-species recovery planning. Natural (e.g., landslides, floods) and anthropogenic (e.g., toxic leaks and spills) catastrophes pose a challenge for evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Pacific salmon listed under the Endangered Species Act and teetering at precariously low population levels. To spread risks among Puget Sound chinook salmon populations, recovery strategies for ESU-wide viability recommend at least two viable populations of historical life-history types in each of five geographic regions. We explored the likelihood of Puget Sound chinook salmon ESU persistence by examining spatial patterns of catastrophic risk and testing ESU viability recommendations for 22 populations of the threatened Puget Sound chinook salmon ESU. We combined geospatial information about catastrophic risks and chinook salmon distribution in Puget Sound watersheds to categorize relative catastrophic risks for each population. We then analyzed similarities in risk scores among regions and compared risk distributions among strategies: (1) population groups selected using the ESU viability recommendations of having populations spread out geographically and including historical life-history diversity, and (2) population groups selected at random. Risks from individual catastrophes varied among populations, but overall risk from catastrophes was similar within geographic regions. Recovery strategies that called for two viable populations in each of five geographic regions had lower risk than random strategies; strategies that included life-history diversity had even lower risks. Geographically distributed populations have varying catastrophic-risks profiles, thus identifying and reinforcing the spatial and life-history diversity critical for populations to respond to environmental change or needed to rescue severely depleted or extirpated populations. Recovery planning can promote viability of Pacific salmon ESUs across the landscape by incorporating catastrophic risk assessments.},

	abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25\% of the world’s total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world’s fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

	abstract = {The separation of the effects of environmental variability from the impacts of fishing has been elusive, but is essential for sound fisheries management(1-7). We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations(4) we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events(1,5,8,9). Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure(1,5,8,9). The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability(7), calls for a precautionary management approach(10,11).},

	abstract = {Rapid declines threaten the persistence of many marine fish. Data
from more than 230 populations reveal a median reduction of 83\% in
breeding population size from known historic levels. Few populations
recover rapidly; most exhibit little or no change in abundance up
to 15 years after a collapse. Reductions in fishing pressure, although
clearly necessary for population recovery, are often insufficient.
Persistence and recovery are also influenced by life history, habitat
alteration, changes to species assemblages, genetic responses to
exploitation, and reductions in population growth attributable to
the Allee effect, also known as depensation. Heightened extinction
risks were highlighted recently when a Canadian population of Atlantic
cod (Gadus morhua) was listed as endangered, on the basis of declines
as high as 99.9\% over 30 years. Unprecedented reductions in abundance
and surprisingly low rates of recovery draw attention to scientists'
limited understanding of how fish behavior, habitat, ecology, and
evolution affect population growth at low abundance. Failure to prevent
population collapses, and to take the conservation biology of marine
fishes seriously, will ensure that many severely depleted species
remain ecological and numerical shadows in the ecosystems that they

	abstract = {The ethical, legal, and social significance of the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) is widely appreciated. Much of the significance of the act arises from the legal definitions that the act provides for the terms threatened species and endangered species. The meanings of these terms are important because they give legal meaning to the concept of a recovered species. Unfortunately, the meanings of these terms are often misapprehended and rarely subjected to formal analysis. We analyzed the legal meaning of recovered species and illustrate key points with details from "recovery" efforts for the gray wolf (Canis lupus). We focused on interpreting the phrase "significant portion of its range," which is part of the legal definition of endangered species. We argue that recovery and endangerment entail a fundamentally normative dimension (i.e., specifying conditions of endangerment) and a fundamentally scientific dimension (i.e., determining whether a species meets the conditions of endangerment). Specifying conditions for endangerment is largely normative because it judges risks of extinction to be either acceptable or unacceptable. Like many other laws that specify what is unacceptable, the ESA largely specifies the conditions that constitute unacceptable extinction risk. The ESA specifies unacceptable risks of extinction by defining endangered species in terms of the portion of a species' range over which a species is "in danger of extinction." Our analysis indicated that (1) legal recovery entails much more than the scientific notion of population viability, (2) most efforts to recover endangered species are grossly inadequate, and (3) many unlisted species meet the legal definition of an endangered or threatened species.},

Selection generated by fishing gear is strong in heavily exploited fish stocks, and the spatial location of fishing can also cause strong selection. The success of selective breeding in aquaculture indicates that significant amounts of genetic variation for production-related traits exist in fish populations.

	abstract = {This essay comments on recent research on Darwinian fisheries science and on the future development of this field. From a practical point of view, the key question is: how fast are evolutionary changes caused by fishing happening? To answer this question, there is a need to understand intensities of selection generated by fishing, heritabilities and genetic correlations of the traits under selection, and whether the rates of change in traits predicted from this information are consistent with the changes observed. Although there is little doubt about the existence of phenotypic change in life-history traits of exploited fish stocks, there are few direct estimates of selection differentials caused by fishing. Results that are available, together with the relatively low heritabilities of life-history traits, suggest that the evolution caused by fishing occurs at a modest rate, and is likely to need a decadal time scale to be clearly observable. Given the pressing need for attention to fisheries in the short term, measures to control the longer-term evolutionary impact of fishing are most likely to be adopted if they also help to meet short-term objectives of management. With this in mind, the essay mounts a defence of large, old fish, the presence of which would be beneficial to stocks in the short term, and the conservation of which would set in motion selection for improved growth in the longer term.},

	abstract = {The probability of different levels of depensation within four taxonomic
groups was calculated using a Bayesian technique called hierarchical
modeling. With this method we combined spawner-recruit data from
many stocks within a taxon to estimate the distribution describing
the variability of depensation within that taxon. The spawner-recruit
model we use allows for both depensation (lower than expected recruits
at low population levels) and hypercompensation (where recruits are
higher than expected at low population levels). The end product of
our analysis is a probability distribution that can be used as a
Bayesian prior when analyzing a new data set. We examined four taxonomic
groups (the salmonids, gadiforms, clupeiforms and pleuronectiforms)
and found that, for all of the taxa, the most likely values fell
close to or within the range of no depensation. However, because
the distributions were very broad we suggest that analysis of stock
recruitment data should incorporate spawner-recruit curves that include
the possibility of depensation and hypercompensation.},

	volume = {22},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18847444},
	abstract = {The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species was increasingly used during the 1980s to assess the conservation status of species for policy and planning purposes. This use stimulated the development of a new set of quantitative criteria for listing species in the categories of threat: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. These criteria, which were intended to be applicable to all species except microorganisms, were part of a broader system for classifying threatened species and were fully implemented by IUCN in 2000. The system and the criteria have been widely used by conservation practitioners and scientists and now underpin one indicator being used to assess the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010 biodiversity target. We describe the process and the technical background to the IUCN Red List system. The criteria refer to fundamental biological processes underlying population decline and extinction. But given major differences between species, the threatening processes affecting them, and the paucity of knowledge relating to most species, the IUCN system had to be both broad and flexible to be applicable to the majority of described species. The system was designed to measure the symptoms of extinction risk, and uses 5 independent criteria relating to aspects of population loss and decline of range size. A species is assigned to a threat category if it meets the quantitative threshold for at least one criterion. The criteria and the accompanying rules and guidelines used by IUCN are intended to increase the consistency, transparency, and validity of its categorization system, but it necessitates some compromises that affect the applicability of the system and the species lists that result. In particular, choices were made over the assessment of uncertainty, poorly known species, depleted species, population decline, restricted ranges, and rarity; all of these affect the way red lists should be viewed and used. Processes related to priority setting and the development of national red lists need to take account of some assumptions in the formulation of the criteria.},

	abstract = {The assumption that spawner biomass is directly proportional to total egg production by fish stocks underlies most spawner-recruit relationships. Despite its importance, this assumption is largely untested. Data describing the reproductive potential of Northeast Arctic (NEA) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were used to test the proportionality assumption for a period showing strong variation in condition and, abundance of spawners. At the individual scale, relative fecundity varied with length and condition. This decreases the likelihood that the proportionality assumption is valid. At the stock level, total egg production was estimated (1985-1996) using acoustic estimates of total abundance and demographic information from trawl sampling in combination with year-specific fecundity-length relationships. For NEA cod, spawner biomass estimated bg virtual population analysis (VPA) was not proportional to total egg production. Compared with VPA-based estimates of spawner biomass, total egg production is an improved index of recruitment potential because (i) the magnitude of variation observed in total egg production was closer to that observed in recruitment and (ii) the relationship between recruitment at age 1 and total egg production approaches the origin. The results suggest that further progress in explaining recruitment variation will be achieved using more sensitive measures of the true reproductive potential of the stock.},

However, a prerequisite for restoration is a general understanding of the composition and abundance of unexploited fish communities, relative to contemporary ones. We constructed trajectories of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning of exploitation. Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80{\textbackslash}\% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10{\textbackslash}\% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions(5) have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems(5-7). Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the `missing baseline('8) needed for future restoration efforts.},

Based on cumulative mortalities in the different experimental groups, relative percentage of survival (RPS) for the high EPA/DHA-low iron group was 70{\textbackslash}\% during an outbreak of furunculosis and 96{\textbackslash}\% during an outbreak of cold water vibriosis compared with the controls. A non-additive effect between EPA/DHA and iron was confirmed by statistical analyses that revealed a significant effect of EPA/DHA alone and an interaction of iron with EPA/DHA. Liver cell cultures treated with EPA/DHA revealed that the synergistic effect could be related to an EPA/DHA dependent regulation of mRNA for proteins important for transport (transferrin) and storage (ferritin) of iron in the salmon. In keeping with this finding, the transcriptional down-regulation of iron metabolism in vitro was reflected in decreased in vivo iron stores with increasing levels of dietary EPA/DHA. Hence, to avoid overloading of the iron transport/storage-systems resulting in increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, high levels of dietary EPA/DHA should be accompanied by low levels of dietary iron.},

	abstract = {In this study, we model daily reproductive output over an entire spawning season for a range of simulated age/size-structured populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), which are created under contrasting stock-recruitment and fishing pressure scenarios. An individual-based modelling approach is used to link empirical relationships with flexible reproductive parameters to quantify and qualify the effects that individual female condition and egg quality can have on stock reproductive potential (SRP) and the temporal distribution of reproductive output. The results of this study indicate that, even with a set of steady state populations that have equal spawning stock biomass (SSB), the differences in population structure brought about by a difference of fishing mortality (F) from 0 to 1.0 will substantially reduce the SRP. Compared to a non-fished population the decline in SRP will range from 48 to 74{\textbackslash}\%, depending upon respective assumptions of egg size on viability. The truncation of population age/size structure due to fishing mortality will also lead to a 4 weeks shorter spawning season and a 2 weeks shift in the date of peak spawning. The effect of low condition of individuals can lead to almost total reproductive failure for the population and the effect of increased condition is dependent upon the population structure in question. Results as such support the view that predictions of recruitment can no longer be based solely as a function of SSB. More careful analysis of the population structure as well as annual dynamics of condition factors and exploration of functional relationships between female characteristics and egg quality are needed to assess and accurately predict survival and the probability of recruitment levels.

Cores taken by diver operated suction sampler were targeted at positions on the ridges and troughs of a reef, in the Irish Sea off north-west Wales, allowing the fauna to be compared between adjoining ridges and troughs. Sessile epifauna was mostly attached to the larger mussels clumped together on the ridges. The crevice fauna and infauna were also nearly three times more abundant on the ridges, but the lists of species were similar from the two subhabitats. Species richness was higher on the ridges, however, diversity and evenness measures were similar for ridges and trough samples. The Modiolus sub-habitats were found to be distinct from other macrofaunal assemblages in the wider southern Irish Sea. Deposition of faecal pellets in the spatially complex habitat amongst the mussels provided conditions suitable for an infauna more typical of inshore muddy sands enriched by organic matter. The scale of the ridge and trough morphology may increase variability between replicates when grabs are used remotely to sample this type of biogenic feature.},

	abstract = {Mytilid bivalves employ a set of threads (the byssus) to attach themselves to both hard and soft substrates. In this study, we measured the mechanical properties of byssal threads from two semi-infaunal mytilids (Geukensia demissa Dillwyn and Modiolus modiolus Linnaeus) and two epifaunal mytilids (Mytilus californianus Conrad and Mytilus edulis Linnaeus). We compared material properties with and without the assumption that changes of length and area during tensile testing are insignificant, demonstrating that previous researchers have overestimated extensibility values by 30\% and may also have underestimated strength values. We detected significant differences in thread properties among tested mytilid species, contrary to previous findings. Threads from semi-infaunal species were significantly thinner than those from epifaunal species, perhaps to allow the production of a greater number of threads, which form a dense network within the substrate. Geukensia demissa threads were weaker than those of the other species, and had a significantly lower stiffness at failure. Modiolus modiolus threads were significantly stiffer than M. edulis threads but also significantly less extensible, suggesting a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility. The only thread property that did not show significant differences across species was toughness – even when byssal threads differ in strength or stiffness, they seem to absorb similar amounts of energy per unit volume prior to failure. This study reveals notable differences between the byssal thread properties of different mytilid bivalves and provides a reliable and thorough methodology for future comparative studies.},

	abstract = {Laboratory experiments have been conducted on byssus thread production by two species of mussel, Mytilus eduIis L. and Modiolus rnodiolus (L.), representing the epibyssate and endobyssate species of the Mytilidae, respectively. Mussels were placed in seven particle sizes of sediment ranging from 50/zm to 16 mm for 12 d. The number of byssus threads per mussel, length of threads, number of threads per particle and size of pads were then recorded. Modiolus rnodiolus (endobyssate) produced more threads than Mytilus edulis (epibyssate). M. edulis produced most threads in the size range 2 to 16 mm and Modiolus modiolus in the size range 500 to 1000 lzm. M. rnodiolus produced longer threads than Mytilus edulis. Both species produced longer threads in particle sizes finer than 2 ram. M. edulis produced smaller pads than Modiolus rnodiolus. Both species produced larger pads in sediments coarser than 1 000/an. Results were also analysed in terms of attachment units (a thread attached to one or more particles, or a particle to which more than one thread is attached). The thread:particle ratio of the attachment units ranged from ca. 1 : 10 in the fmest sediments to ca. 10 : 1 in the coarsest sediments. Mytilus edulis attached more threads to single particles (72\% of attachment units) than Modiolus rnodiolus (37\% of attachment units). M. rnodiolus had a wider spread of ratios in the finer particle sizes than Mytilus edulis. The sigmificance of our results are discussed in relation to the ecology and palaeoecology of epibyssate and endobysste species.},

The extent of the reef could therefore be determined and the benthic structure reliably mapped. The biogenic reef is in an area with moderately strong tidal currents and overlays lag gravel and cobbles with patchy sand veneers. The mussels form an undulating surface, orientated perpendicular to the current, with an average wavelength of 11.7 m and amplitude of 0.24 m that is signiﬁcantly different from the surrounding seabed. Reef deposits reach a thickness of 1 m on top of the underlying lag gravels. The characteristic reef surface morphology helps distinguish the reef from the surrounding seabed on side-scan sonar and multibeam echosounder records and the undulations create the spatial complexity that inﬂuences the small-scale distribution of the associated epifauna, and infauna, reported in papers II and III of this series. The M. modiolus reef was recorded in the same location 40 y ago and has probably persisted there for over 150 y. Monitoring implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Information about seabed stability and sediment dynamics is part of the fundamental geoscience knowledge required for the extraction of tidal energy in the Bay of Fundy and for the integrated management of the Bay. Waves, tidal currents, and wind-driven and circulation currents were obtained from oceanographic models to assess the wave and current processes for the broader Bay of Fundy. The wave and current outputs were coupled with observed grain size in a sediment transport model to predict, for the ﬁrst time, the seabed shear stresses, sediment mobility, and sediment transport patterns for the entire Bay. The root mean square tidal current, highest in the upper Bay (1.4 m·s−1), is reduced to moderate in the central Bay (0.5–0.8 m·s−1) and decreases further in the outer Bay (0.2–0.5 m·s−1). The maximum tidal current occurs in the Minas Passage and is 5 m·s−1. The mean signiﬁcant wave height, in contrast, is the greatest in the outer Bay (ϳ1.3 m) and gradually decreases to the northeast in the central and upper Bay (0.5 m). Seabed shear in the Bay of Fundy is mostly due to tides, and wave effects are only important in coastal areas. The strongest mean shear velocity of 10 cm·s−1 occurs in the Minas Passage area. Strong shear velocity of 4–5 cm·s−1 also occurs in Minas Basin, in the central Bay, and in the narrows around Grand Manan Island. Sediment mobilization in the Bay of Fundy is predominantly by tidal current. Mobilization frequency is 30\% of the time over most of the Bay and reaches 100\% of the time in some areas. The maximum total-load sediment transport rate under spring tide can reach ϳ5 kg·m−1·s−1 and is to the northeast during ﬂood and to the southwest during ebb. Net sediment transport ﬂux, however, is dominantly to the northeast and reaches 2 kg·m−1·s−1. Eddies of net transport are found to occur around headlands and at the narrows of Grand Manan Island, largely due to the occurrence of eddies of residual tidal ﬂows. The regional distribution of substrate types and bedform ﬁelds and patterns of seabed erosion and deposition are well correlated with tidal current strength and sediment transport patterns.},

Shellﬁsh can inﬂuence the surrounding water column and modify the quality of material that reaches the seabed by ﬁltering water, actively depositing particles and changing the benthic boundary layer due to surface roughness. In the present study M. modiolus biodeposition was measured in a ﬁeld location for the ﬁrst time. The results show that M. modiolus enhance sedimentation and contribute to the downward ﬂux of material to the seabed. Approximately 30\% of the total sediment deposition was attributed to active ﬁlter feeding and overall, the presence of horse mussels enhanced deposition two fold. The results are discussed in terms of the potential for horse mussel reefs to provide ecosystem services to society, through functions such as benthopelagic coupling and sediment stabilisation. Highlighting the societal beneﬁts supplied by marine habitats can help prioritise conservation efforts and feed into the sustainable management of coastal water bodies.},

	abstract = {Analysis of presence / absence records from two comparable megabenthic surveys of scallop grounds in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, in 1966–67 and 1997 showed profound change over three decades. There were no indications that any species were lost and the average number of taxa per station remained steady. However, spatial heterogeneities in the community were reduced and species composition changed significantly. Some taxa widespread in 1966–67 declined while others expanded, with frequencies of occurrence of individual taxa changing by up to 71\%. The whelks Buccinum undatum and Colus spp., the bivalves Astarte spp. and Cyclocardia borealis, the toad crabs Hyas spp., the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and the brittle stars (Ophiurida) showed particular increases. Corresponding declines were seen in the boring sponges Cliona spp., the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus, the scallop Chlamys islandica, the fan worm Pseudopotamilla reniformis and the stalked tunicate Boltenia ovifera. Replacement of attached, fragile, epifaunal, filter-feeding taxa by a combination of motile scavengers, motile filter-feeders and robust, burrowing filter-feeders suggests that the primary cause of the temporal change was physical impacts by fishing gear, even though trawling and scallop dragging in the area were neither intense nor new developments. Secondary causes of change may have included other ecosystem effects of fishing (supply of discards and bait), a mass mortality of scallops and a range expansion of a bryozoan (Flustra foliacea).},

A simulation of the Quoddy region of the Bay of Fundy also gave good results when calibrated against available observations.

Thus, we exposed intact sediment cores containing European ﬂat oysters (Ostrea edulis) or blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in seawater to two diﬀerent densities (2.5 or 25 μg L−1) of biodegradable or conventional microplastics in outdoor mesocosms. We hypothesized that ﬁltration rates of the bivalves, inorganic nitrogen cycling, primary productivity of sediment dwelling microphytobenthos, and the structure of invertebrate benthic assemblages would be inﬂuenced by microplastics. After 50 days, ﬁltration by M. edulis was signiﬁcantly less when exposed to 25 μg L−1 of either type of microplastics, but there were no eﬀects on ecosystem functioning or the associated invertebrate assemblages. Contrastingly, ﬁltration by O. edulis signiﬁcantly increased when exposed to 2.5 or 25 μg L−1 of microplastics, and porewater ammonium and biomass of benthic cyanobacteria decreased. Additionally the associated infaunal invertebrate assemblages diﬀered, with signiﬁcantly less polychaetes and more oligochaetes in treatments exposed to microplastics. These ﬁndings highlight the potential of microplastics to impact the functioning and structure of sedimentary habitats and show that such eﬀects may depend on the dominant bivalve present.},

	abstract = {Biogenic reefs created by Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758) (horse mussel reefs) are marine habitats which support high levels of species biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services. Currently, M. modiolus reefs are listed as a threatened and/or declining species and habitat in all OSPAR regions and thus are highlighted as a conservation priority under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Determining patterns of larval dispersal and genetic connectivity of remaining horse mussel populations can inform management efforts and is a critical component of effective marine spatial planning (MSP). Larval dispersal patterns and genetic structure were determined for several M. modiolus bed populations in the Irish Sea including those in Wales (North Pen Llŷn), Isle of Man (Point of Ayre) and Northern Ireland (Ards Peninsula and Strangford Lough). Simulations of larval dispersal suggested extant connectivity between populations within the Irish Sea. Results from the genetic analysis carried out using newly developed microsatellite DNA markers were consistent with those of the biophysical model. Results indicated moderately significant differentiation between the Northern Ireland populations and those in the Isle of Man and Wales. Simulations of larval dispersal over a 30 day pelagic larval duration (PLD) suggest that connectivity over a spatial scale of 150km is possible between some source and sink populations. However, it appears unlikely that larvae from Northern Ireland will connect directly with sites on the Llŷn or Isle of Man. It also appears unlikely that larvae from the Llŷn connect directly to any of the other sites. Taken together the data establishes a baseline for underpinning management and conservation of these important and threatened marine habitats in the southern part of the known range.},

	abstract = {Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) can alter the strength of byssal attachment and move between and within mussel aggregations on wave-swept shores, but this movement ability may be limited by epibiont fouling. We quantiﬁed the effects of artiﬁcial epibiont fouling on the production of byssal threads, attachment strength, and movement in two size classes of blue mussels. In a factorial experiment, large epibiont-covered mussels produced more functional byssal threads (i.e., those continuous from animal to substrate) after 24 h than large unfouled and small fouled mussels, but not more than small unfouled mussels. Small unfouled mussels formed and released more byssus bundles compared to any other treatment group, which indicates increased movement. Conversely, epibiont fouling resulted in decreased numbers of byssus bundles shed, and therefore reduced movement in small mussels. Epibiont-covered mussels started producing byssal threads sooner than unfouled mussels, while small mussels began producing byssal threads earlier compared to large mussels. Mean attachment strength from both size classes increased by 9.5\% when mussels were artiﬁcially fouled, and large mussels had a 34\% stronger attachment compared to small mussels. On the other hand, a 2.3\% decrease in attachment strength was found with increasing byssus bundles shed. Our results suggest that fouling by artiﬁcial epibionts inﬂuences byssal thread production and attachment strength in large mussels, whereas epibionts on small mussels impact their ability to move. Mussels are able to respond rapidly to fouling, which carries implications for the dynamics of mussel beds in their intertidal and subtidal habitats, especially in relation to movement of mussels within and among aggregations.},

	abstract = {An experimental artiﬁcial reef was constructed in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland as part of trials to regenerate damaged biogenic reefs formed by the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus. Experimental reef plots were constructed using Pecten maximus shell as cultch. Clumps of live adult M. modiolus were translocated from nearby natural reefs into cultch with a high proﬁle (elevated cultch), cultch with a low proﬁle (ﬂattened cultch), as well as directly into the seaﬂoor. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that translocated mussel clumps would increase habitat complexity thus accelerating community succession and enhancing natural recruitment of M. modiolus spat. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to greater protection from predators and increased accessibility to food resources. Within the artiﬁcial reef array the translocated clumps had a signiﬁcant positive effect on recruitment compared to cultch without mussels with average densities of spat settled on the translocated M. modiolus clumps ranging from 100 to 200 individuals m−2 compared to 4 to 52 spat m−2 on cultch without mussels. Recruitment of M. modiolus spat was also signiﬁcantly higher on translocated horse mussels when compared to natural reefs where densities of 8–36 spat m−2 were recorded. Reef elevation appeared to provide some degree of protection from predators but differences in translocated M. modiolus survival on the different elevation treatments were not signiﬁcant. In total, 223 taxa were recorded 12 months after reef construction. The presence of translocated clumps of M. modiolus was the main driver of the increases in faunal diversity and species abundance. Application of objective criteria to assess the performance of artiﬁcial reefs suggested that translocation of M. modiolus clumps alone achieved most of the restoration objectives. Consequently this pilot study demonstrates a straightforward and realistic intervention technique that could be used to kick start the regeneration and expansion of impacted mussel and similar biogenic reefs elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Selection of sites for successful restoration of impacted shellﬁsh populations depends on understanding the dispersion capability and habitat requirements of the species involved. In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs. The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely dependent on the tides and not inﬂuenced by wind or waves. Higher reef elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment. There was also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As a result of this work and in conjunction with other ﬁeld work we propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each of the identiﬁed self-recruiting areas.},

	abstract = {The boreal bivalve Modiolus modiolus is common subtidally where it aggregates to form extensive, long-lived, biogenic habitats with a diverse associated flora and, especially, fauna. Despite this ecological importance, M. modiolus has not been described in terms of its functional morphology and overall biology. Modiolus modiolus is a typical epibenthic, suspensionfeeding mytilid, albeit with anatomical modifications adapting it to a partially buried, gregarious lifestyle in a stable environment experiencing medium–high energy levels. The juvenile shell is covered partly in byssal setae secreted by the byssal gland and foot complex and becomes covered in sand grains held in place by a mucoid cement secreted by the dorsal mantle. The camouflaged shell at this vulnerable time probably serves as an anti-predator device. Individuals grow to maximum shell lengths of ∼60–213 mm, depending on depth and locality. With age (≥ 20–45 years), shells often become deformed, particularly posteriorly and around the byssal gape, thereby increasing reproductive capacity (gonadal volume) without increasing somatic growth. Information on the biology, reproductive strategy and life history traits of M. modiolus are reviewed. These field- and laboratory-derived data provide us with essential information to aid future research into the protection and conservation of this ecologically important biogenic habitat. This is because, today, dredging and fishery activities using bottom-towed gear have seriously damaged several M. modiolus habitats with deleterious impacts on ecosystem functioning. Post-impact recovery times are slow and dependent on both local and mega-population distributions.},

	abstract = {This study describes the impact of the first passage of two types of bottom-towed fishing gear on rare protected shellfishreefs formed by the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.). One of the study sites was trawled and the other was scallopdredged. Divers collected HD video imagery of epifauna from quadrats at the two study sites and directed infaunal samples from one site. The total number of epifaunal organisms was significantly reduced following a single pass of a trawl (90\%) or scallop dredge (59\%), as was the diversity of the associated community and the total number of M. modiolus at the trawled site. At both sites declines in anthozoans, hydrozoans, bivalves, echinoderms and ascidians accounted for most of the change. A year later, no recovery was evident at the trawled site and significantly fewer infaunal taxa (polychaetes, malacostracans, bivalves and ophuroids) were recorded in the trawl track. The severity of the two types of impact reflected the undisturbed status of the habitats compared to previous studies. As a ‘priority habitat’ the nature of the impacts described on M. modiolus communities are important to the development of conservation management policy and indicators of condition in Marine Protected Areas (EU Habitats Directive) as well as indicators of ‘Good Environmental Status’ under the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Conservation managers are under pressure to support decisions with good quality evidence. Elsewhere, indirect studies have shown declines of M. modiolus biogenic communities in fishing grounds. However, given the protected status of the rare habitat, premeditated demonstration of direct impact is unethical or illegal in Marine Protected Areas. This study therefore provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact from fishing gear whilst at the same time reflecting on the dilemma of evidence-based conservation management.},

In this study, we evaluated the contribution of mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii, Mytilus edulis platensis, and Perna perna) to the benthic species richness of intertidal and shallow subtidal communities at Cerro Verde (Uruguay). We compared the richness of macro-benthic species between mussel-engineered patches and patches without mussels but dominated by algae or barnacles at a landscape scale (all samples), between tidal levels, and between sites distributed along a wave exposition gradient. Overall, we found a net increase in species richness in samples with mussels (35 species), in contrast to samples where mussels were naturally absent or scarce (27 species). The positive trend of the effect did not depend upon tidal level or wave exposition, but its magnitude varied between sites. Within sites, a signiﬁcant positive effect was detected only at the protected site. Within the musselengineered patches, the richness of all macro-faunal groups (total, sessile and mobile) was positively correlated with mussel abundance. This evidence indicates that the mussel beds studied here were important in maintaining species richness at the landscape-level, and highlights that beds of shelled bivalves should not be neglected as conservation targets in marine benthic environments.},

These reefs are often established by dense aggregations of a single taxa and understanding the fundamental principles of biogenic reef formation is needed for their conservation and restoration. We tested whether substratum type and density affected the aggregation behaviour of two important biogenic-reef forming species, the horse mussel, Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758), and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758). First, we tested for effects of substratum type on mussel movement and aggregation behaviour by manipulating substrata available to mussels in mesocosms (three treatments: no sediment added, sediment added, sediment and shells added). Both mussel species moved less in treatments with sediment and with both sediment and shells present than when no sediment or shells were added and the percentage of these mussels that aggregated (clumps of two or more individuals) was lower when shells were present compared to treatments without shells, however, fewer M. modiolus attached to shells than M. edulis. There was no effect of different substratum type on patch complexity of either mussel species. In addition, motivated by our interest in the restoration of M. modiolus, we also tested experimentally whether the aggregation behaviour of M. modiolus was density-dependent. M. modiolus moved a similar distance in three density treatments (100, 200 and 300 mussels m−2), however, their aggregation rate appeared to be greater when mussel density was higher, suggesting that the encounter rate of individuals is an important factor for aggregation. M. modiolus also formed aggregations with a higher fractal dimension in the high and medium density treatments compared to lower density, suggesting that at higher density this increased patch complexity could further facilitate increased recruitment with the enhanced habitat available for settlement. These ﬁndings add to the growing evidence showing that adding dead shells to substratum to encourage M. modiolus restoration is not likely to be effective. Our ﬁndings suggest that mussel density is a more important driver for patch and subsequently reef formation. Moreover, two seemingly functionally similar mussel species showed some differences in their behaviour (e.g. attachment to shells). This highlights the importance of considering the speciﬁc ecology of a target species, such as M. modiolus, when designing restoration methods because information garnered from experimentation on an ostensibly similar species (e.g. M. edulis) may not be appropriate.},

	abstract = {Protruding bodies,” such as kelp stems, seagrasses, filiform algae, artificial reefs, and engineered structures, constitute substrata for proliferation of benthic communities of great ecological and economical importance. Unfortunately, very little is known of hydrodynamic aspects of settlement in such habitats. Based on flow-tank experiments and theoretical considerations, we discuss hydrodynamic interference with settlement of larvae on protrudingbody habitats. We suggest that larvae may overcome these interferences by producing mucous threads up to 100 body lengths in size. These adhesive threads enable propagules of suspension feeders to settle in environments of high food-particle flux and low sedimentation rate. The results suggest that hydrodynamic impediments to encounter play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of benthic species on protruding bodies by favoring propagules of species with such adhesive devices.},

Over 88\% of the production was by suspension feeders of which the horse mussel, Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758), was by far the largest contributor. The geographic distribution of production of the major, soft-sediment, epi- and infaunal trophic groups in the lower Bay of Fundy was in general agreement with the hypothesis that tidal currents are a major determinant of benthic distribution and production in the lower Bay.

Presented here is a preliminary attempt to use modern surﬁcial geological techniques, including sidescan sonar and a high resolution seismic reﬂection system to map the distribution of bivalve reefs in the Bay of Fundy. Acoustic techniques were groundtruthed with a 0.5-m2 video grab. The grab jaws could be hydaulically closed from the deploying vessel on the basis of a video view of the sediment from a camera focused between the grab jaws. Sampling was limited to the upper Bay of Fundy where ﬁve geological provinces were recognized. Preliminary results show that horse mussels are limited to the harder, more stable sedimentary provinces (gravel/cobble and mottled gravel), but also to an intermediate province: sand with bioherms. The latter are raised features formed by the horse mussels on megarippled sand which are long and thin, and ﬂow-parallel structures covered with epifauna. Although positive, the present data are insufﬁcient to conclude whether acoustic methods can signiﬁcantly improve on conventional benthic grab sampling methods to map benthic production.},

This study combined (i) new survey data (a dedicated multibeam echosounder survey of the Lough), (ii) a habitat suitability model for M. modiolus with (iii) historical diver surveys to estimate the extent and abundance before 1986 (before the suspected period of greatest decline), 2003 (during the introduction of a ban on mobile fishing gear in the Lough) and 2007 (the most recent diver survey available). Estimations indicate that the extent reduced from approximately 12.6km2 in 1986 to just 5.7km2 by 2007 and the abundance declined by 87\% in the same period. The decline has implications both for the remaining population of M. modiolus and ecosystem functionality within the Lough, which are both discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {Onega Bay is the largest bay in the White Sea, characterised by shallow depth, a range of sediment types and strong tidal currents. All these factors provide conditions for high species richness and biomass. This study reviews data from three surveys of sublittoral macrobenthos undertaken by Russian institutes: the benthic survey covering the entire Onega Bay in 1952; the survey performed in the northern part of the area in 1981 ⁄ 90, and a study carried out in 2006 in the eastern part of the bay. In total, data from 107 stations were analysed. The data in different surveys were collected by different grab types. The datasets of both 1981 ⁄ 90 and 2006 overlap the 1952 survey area. The pattern of biomass distribution was consistent between the years of survey and was characterised by the low biomass at the northern periphery of the bay and the highest biomass observed in the coastal waters of the Solovetsky Islands. Bivalves and cirripeds (mostly Modiolus modiolus, Arctica islandica, Balanus balanus and Verucca stroemia) dominated in biomass. Neither the biomass share of dominant species nor the frequency of occurrence of several common species in these groups changed markedly between 1952 and 1981 ⁄ 90. Although the results of the 2006 survey appear somewhat different from the patterns of previous years, this does not indicate major changes in the benthic communities, because the survey in 2006 was designed in a different way and its overlap with the 1952 survey was minimal. However, the dominant species (by biomass) –A. islandica, M. modiolus and V. stroemia – held their leading positions. Results of the multidimensional scaling analysis based on the biomass data for all taxa encountered in the 1952 survey indicate considerable mixing of the samples from all surveys. This may be interpreted as the absence of major shifts in the sublittoral communities of the macrobenthos of Onega Bay at decadal scale. This kind of stability may be explained by an oceanographical regime resilient to climate variation and a relatively low anthropogenic environmental impact when compared to other shallow European seas.},

As of 2010, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and landings are reported for both fleets combined. In 2012, a total of 167.2 t was landed against the TAC of 160 t. There was an additional Food, Social and Ceremonial catch of 4.7 t. From 2011 to 2012, catch rates declined or stayed the same in subareas A, C, D and E, but increased by over 40\% in subarea B. In 2012, there was an increase in the mean number of commercial scallops in the survey for subareas A, B, and D, and no change in C. The number of recruit size scallops per tow increased in subareas A, B, and C, but did not change in D. Prerecruits showed an increase in all subareas. The mean weight per tow and survey biomass increased in subareas A to D from 2011 to 2012. Condition factors increased in subareas A to D, but the increase was less dramatic in subarea D. Some of the highest growth rates for SFA 29 West were observed in 2012, particularly in subarea B. Two methods were used to estimate exploitation rates in SFA 29 West: one from commercial catch rates, representing more localized conditions, and one from the research survey, representing broader conditions. Trends in annual total fishing effort (hours fished) were also presented since effort is assumed to be directly related to fishing mortality. From 2011 to 2012, effort decreased in subareas A and D by 94 and 48\%, respectively, while smaller decreases in effort were recorded for subareas B (10\%) and C (12\%). Exploitation estimates generally indicated a decrease in all subareas in 2012. A total TAC similar to that in 2012 is recommended. A reduction in TAC in subarea C would promote recovery of this area, and an increase in TAC in subarea B would be consistent with the observed increase in abundance and biomass in this area. The estimated number of lobster caught represents 0.01\% of the lobsters caught in the 2011/2012 Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34 lobster fishery and 0.05\% of the lobsters caught in the area of LFA 34 corresponding to SFA 29 West.

	abstract = {During 2010 a set of 22 voluntary closed areas, distributed around Shetland, were proposed by local industry in order to help protect and conserve threatened habitats from potential physical disturbance from scallop dredging. Initially, closed areas were implemented on a precautionary basis over predicted beds of maerl and horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) derived from historical data. Horse mussel and maerl beds are classed as priority habitats which have been identiﬁed as being threatened and requiring conservation under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). Legalisation of the voluntarily adopted closed areas occurred in 2011. Detailed surveys were conducted to map each closed area with speciﬁc reference to the deﬁning features located within. Closed areas were surveyed using a hull mounted multibeam system and ground-truthed with an underwater camera system. Information was imported to a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to create georeferenced habitat maps of the two species of interest. The appropriateness of each closed area was assessed and a proposed methodology and procedure outlined for any future closed areas. The primary aim was to provide information on which to test the validity of initial closed area boundaries and subsequently allow managers to reﬁne and add to them in the future. The survey illustrated the need to have good quality acoustic and visual survey work undertaken whenever areas have been closed based on historical data and/or predicted habitats. Predicted beds were not found to be representative of the survey ﬁndings. The survey highlighted the lack of good quality, robust, accurate, and up to date species information for the waters around Shetland, especially with regard to priority marine features. Although some were neither fully protecting the UK BAP habitats they were designed to protect nor were protecting any UK BAP habitats, a degree of protection had been conferred to some priority features in the ﬁrst iteration of implementation of closed areas. Survey data were subsequently used to legally alter the closed area boundaries to more appropriately reﬂect the distribution of priority features. Recommendations were made on appropriate procedures for deﬁning a species bed and on the wider implications of the study’s ﬁndings for other ﬁsheries areas developing spatial management plans.},

	abstract = {The macrotidal Bay of Fundy, Canada, was systematically mapped in the early 2000s using multibeam sonar technology, partly to support efforts to develop hydropower. The primary product was a suite of 1:50,000-scale maps of shaded seaﬂoor relief and backscatter. In addition, a ‘seascape’ map was produced in an attempt to classify the entire bay in terms of morphology, texture, and biota. The eight seascape groups that are delineated reﬂect the strong signature of glaciation in much of the bay, the effects of Holocene tidal range expansion, and the results of modern processes under a dynamic current regime. As a result of the recent mapping we are able to argue that the muddy depocentre in the southwest of the bay was primarily active before the well-documented expansion of tidal range that occurred in the Bay of Fundy in the Holocene epoch. We further demonstrate the complexity of the seaﬂoor in one of the glacial seascapes, and discuss the morphology and stability of a major tidal scour. The evidence obtained from multibeam sonar mapping reveals the complexity of the sea ﬂoor in the Bay of Fundy not necessarily apparent on the 1977 surﬁcial geology map based on sparse lines of single-beam echo sounder data.},

Cores taken by diver operated suction sampler were targeted at positions on the ridges and troughs of a reef, in the Irish Sea off north-west Wales, allowing the fauna to be compared between adjoining ridges and troughs. Sessile epifauna was mostly attached to the larger mussels clumped together on the ridges. The crevice fauna and infauna were also nearly three times more abundant on the ridges, but the lists of species were similar from the two subhabitats. Species richness was higher on the ridges, however, diversity and evenness measures were similar for ridges and trough samples. The Modiolus sub-habitats were found to be distinct from other macrofaunal assemblages in the wider southern Irish Sea. Deposition of faecal pellets in the spatially complex habitat amongst the mussels provided conditions suitable for an infauna more typical of inshore muddy sands enriched by organic matter. The scale of the ridge and trough morphology may increase variability between replicates when grabs are used remotely to sample this type of biogenic feature.},

	abstract = {Mytilid bivalves employ a set of threads (the byssus) to attach themselves to both hard and soft substrates. In this study, we measured the mechanical properties of byssal threads from two semi-infaunal mytilids (Geukensia demissa Dillwyn and Modiolus modiolus Linnaeus) and two epifaunal mytilids (Mytilus californianus Conrad and Mytilus edulis Linnaeus). We compared material properties with and without the assumption that changes of length and area during tensile testing are insignificant, demonstrating that previous researchers have overestimated extensibility values by 30\% and may also have underestimated strength values. We detected significant differences in thread properties among tested mytilid species, contrary to previous findings. Threads from semi-infaunal species were significantly thinner than those from epifaunal species, perhaps to allow the production of a greater number of threads, which form a dense network within the substrate. Geukensia demissa threads were weaker than those of the other species, and had a significantly lower stiffness at failure. Modiolus modiolus threads were significantly stiffer than M. edulis threads but also significantly less extensible, suggesting a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility. The only thread property that did not show significant differences across species was toughness – even when byssal threads differ in strength or stiffness, they seem to absorb similar amounts of energy per unit volume prior to failure. This study reveals notable differences between the byssal thread properties of different mytilid bivalves and provides a reliable and thorough methodology for future comparative studies.},

Mussels were placed in seven particle sizes of sediment ranging from 50/zm to 16 mm for 12 d. The number of byssus threads per mussel, length of threads, number of threads per particle and size of pads were then recorded. Modiolus rnodiolus (endobyssate) produced more threads than Mytilus edulis (epibyssate). M. edulis produced most threads in the size range 2 to 16 mm and Modiolus modiolus in the size range 500 to 1000 lzm. M. rnodiolus produced longer threads than Mytilus edulis. Both species produced longer threads in particle sizes finer than 2 ram. M. edulis produced smaller pads than Modiolus rnodiolus. Both species produced larger pads in sediments coarser than 1 000/an. Results were also analysed in terms of attachment units (a thread attached to one or more particles, or a particle to which more than one thread is attached). The thread:particle ratio of the attachment units ranged from ca. 1 : 10 in the fmest sediments to ca. 10 : 1 in the coarsest sediments. Mytilus edulis attached more threads to single particles (72\% of attachment units) than Modiolus rnodiolus (37\% of attachment units). M. rnodiolus had a wider spread of ratios in the finer particle sizes than Mytilus edulis. The sigmificance of our results are discussed in relation to the ecology and palaeoecology of epibyssate and endobysste species.},

The extent of the reef could therefore be determined and the benthic structure reliably mapped. The biogenic reef is in an area with moderately strong tidal currents and overlays lag gravel and cobbles with patchy sand veneers. The mussels form an undulating surface, orientated perpendicular to the current, with an average wavelength of 11.7 m and amplitude of 0.24 m that is signiﬁcantly different from the surrounding seabed. Reef deposits reach a thickness of 1 m on top of the underlying lag gravels. The characteristic reef surface morphology helps distinguish the reef from the surrounding seabed on side-scan sonar and multibeam echosounder records and the undulations create the spatial complexity that inﬂuences the small-scale distribution of the associated epifauna, and infauna, reported in papers II and III of this series. The M. modiolus reef was recorded in the same location 40 y ago and has probably persisted there for over 150 y. Monitoring implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Information about seabed stability and sediment dynamics is part of the fundamental geoscience knowledge required for the extraction of tidal energy in the Bay of Fundy and for the integrated management of the Bay. Waves, tidal currents, and wind-driven and circulation currents were obtained from oceanographic models to assess the wave and current processes for the broader Bay of Fundy. The wave and current outputs were coupled with observed grain size in a sediment transport model to predict, for the ﬁrst time, the seabed shear stresses, sediment mobility, and sediment transport patterns for the entire Bay. The root mean square tidal current, highest in the upper Bay ({\textgreater}1.4 m·s−1), is reduced to moderate in the central Bay (0.5–0.8 m·s−1) and decreases further in the outer Bay (0.2–0.5 m·s−1). The maximum tidal current occurs in the Minas Passage and is {\textgreater}5 m·s−1. The mean signiﬁcant wave height, in contrast, is the greatest in the outer Bay (ϳ1.3 m) and gradually decreases to the northeast in the central and upper Bay ({\textless}0.5 m). Seabed shear in the Bay of Fundy is mostly due to tides, and wave effects are only important in coastal areas. The strongest mean shear velocity of 10 cm·s−1 occurs in the Minas Passage area. Strong shear velocity of 4–5 cm·s−1 also occurs in Minas Basin, in the central Bay, and in the narrows around Grand Manan Island. Sediment mobilization in the Bay of Fundy is predominantly by tidal current. Mobilization frequency is {\textgreater}30\% of the time over most of the Bay and reaches 100\% of the time in some areas. The maximum total-load sediment transport rate under spring tide can reach ϳ5 kg·m−1·s−1 and is to the northeast during ﬂood and to the southwest during ebb. Net sediment transport ﬂux, however, is dominantly to the northeast and reaches 2 kg·m−1·s−1. Eddies of net transport are found to occur around headlands and at the narrows of Grand Manan Island, largely due to the occurrence of eddies of residual tidal ﬂows. The regional distribution of substrate types and bedform ﬁelds and patterns of seabed erosion and deposition are well correlated with tidal current strength and sediment transport patterns.},

Shellﬁsh can inﬂuence the surrounding water column and modify the quality of material that reaches the seabed by ﬁltering water, actively depositing particles and changing the benthic boundary layer due to surface roughness. In the present study M. modiolus biodeposition was measured in a ﬁeld location for the ﬁrst time. The results show that M. modiolus enhance sedimentation and contribute to the downward ﬂux of material to the seabed. Approximately 30\% of the total sediment deposition was attributed to active ﬁlter feeding and overall, the presence of horse mussels enhanced deposition two fold. The results are discussed in terms of the potential for horse mussel reefs to provide ecosystem services to society, through functions such as benthopelagic coupling and sediment stabilisation. Highlighting the societal beneﬁts supplied by marine habitats can help prioritise conservation efforts and feed into the sustainable management of coastal water bodies.},

	abstract = {Analysis of presence / absence records from two comparable megabenthic surveys of scallop grounds in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, in 1966–67 and 1997 showed profound change over three decades. There were no indications that any species were lost and the average number of taxa per station remained steady. However, spatial heterogeneities in the community were reduced and species composition changed significantly. Some taxa widespread in 1966–67 declined while others expanded, with frequencies of occurrence of individual taxa changing by up to 71\%. The whelks Buccinum undatum and Colus spp., the bivalves Astarte spp. and Cyclocardia borealis, the toad crabs Hyas spp., the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and the brittle stars (Ophiurida) showed particular increases. Corresponding declines were seen in the boring sponges Cliona spp., the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus, the scallop Chlamys islandica, the fan worm Pseudopotamilla reniformis and the stalked tunicate Boltenia ovifera. Replacement of attached, fragile, epifaunal, filter-feeding taxa by a combination of motile scavengers, motile filter-feeders and robust, burrowing filter-feeders suggests that the primary cause of the temporal change was physical impacts by fishing gear, even though trawling and scallop dragging in the area were neither intense nor new developments. Secondary causes of change may have included other ecosystem effects of fishing (supply of discards and bait), a mass mortality of scallops and a range expansion of a bryozoan (Flustra foliacea).},

The new algorithm sets velocities in dry areas to zero and removes elements from the computation when they are completely dry. Model tests simulating an idealized sloping beach that includes a tidal pool and a narrow deep channel laterally bounded by shallow drying sides, give qualitatively reasonable results. A simulation of the Quoddy region of the Bay of Fundy also gave good results when calibrated against available observations. This region includes extensive intertidal ﬂats, tidal pools and channels that are blocked at low water by emerging shallows. The model is a clear improvement over a three-dimensional linear model and a fully nonlinear model without the drying routines using the same model grid. The drying model reproduces the tidal elevations with higher accuracy and has more realistic tidal currents.},

Thus, we exposed intact sediment cores containing European ﬂat oysters (Ostrea edulis) or blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in seawater to two diﬀerent densities (2.5 or 25 μg L−1) of biodegradable or conventional microplastics in outdoor mesocosms. We hypothesized that ﬁltration rates of the bivalves, inorganic nitrogen cycling, primary productivity of sediment dwelling microphytobenthos, and the structure of invertebrate benthic assemblages would be inﬂuenced by microplastics. After 50 days, ﬁltration by M. edulis was signiﬁcantly less when exposed to 25 μg L−1 of either type of microplastics, but there were no eﬀects on ecosystem functioning or the associated invertebrate assemblages. Contrastingly, ﬁltration by O. edulis signiﬁcantly increased when exposed to 2.5 or 25 μg L−1 of microplastics, and porewater ammonium and biomass of benthic cyanobacteria decreased. Additionally the associated infaunal invertebrate assemblages diﬀered, with signiﬁcantly less polychaetes and more oligochaetes in treatments exposed to microplastics. These ﬁndings highlight the potential of microplastics to impact the functioning and structure of sedimentary habitats and show that such eﬀects may depend on the dominant bivalve present.},

Currently, M. modiolus reefs are listed as a threatened and/or declining species and habitat in all OSPAR regions and thus are highlighted as a conservation priority under the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Determining patterns of larval dispersal and genetic connectivity of remaining horse mussel populations can inform management efforts and is a critical component of effective marine spatial planning (MSP). Larval dispersal patterns and genetic structure were determined for several M. modiolus bed populations in the Irish Sea including those in Wales (North Pen Llŷn), Isle of Man (Point of Ayre) and Northern Ireland (Ards Peninsula and Strangford Lough). Simulations of larval dispersal suggested extant connectivity between populations within the Irish Sea. Results from the genetic analysis carried out using newly developed microsatellite DNA markers were consistent with those of the biophysical model. Results indicated moderately significant differentiation between the Northern Ireland populations and those in the Isle of Man and Wales. Simulations of larval dispersal over a 30 day pelagic larval duration (PLD) suggest that connectivity over a spatial scale of 150km is possible between some source and sink populations. However, it appears unlikely that larvae from Northern Ireland will connect directly with sites on the Llŷn or Isle of Man. It also appears unlikely that larvae from the Llŷn connect directly to any of the other sites. Taken together the data establishes a baseline for underpinning management and conservation of these important and threatened marine habitats in the southern part of the known range.},

	abstract = {Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) can alter the strength of byssal attachment and move between and within mussel aggregations on wave-swept shores, but this movement ability may be limited by epibiont fouling. We quantiﬁed the effects of artiﬁcial epibiont fouling on the production of byssal threads, attachment strength, and movement in two size classes of blue mussels. In a factorial experiment, large epibiont-covered mussels produced more functional byssal threads (i.e., those continuous from animal to substrate) after 24 h than large unfouled and small fouled mussels, but not more than small unfouled mussels. Small unfouled mussels formed and released more byssus bundles compared to any other treatment group, which indicates increased movement. Conversely, epibiont fouling resulted in decreased numbers of byssus bundles shed, and therefore reduced movement in small mussels. Epibiont-covered mussels started producing byssal threads sooner than unfouled mussels, while small mussels began producing byssal threads earlier compared to large mussels. Mean attachment strength from both size classes increased by 9.5\% when mussels were artiﬁcially fouled, and large mussels had a 34\% stronger attachment compared to small mussels. On the other hand, a 2.3\% decrease in attachment strength was found with increasing byssus bundles shed. Our results suggest that fouling by artiﬁcial epibionts inﬂuences byssal thread production and attachment strength in large mussels, whereas epibionts on small mussels impact their ability to move. Mussels are able to respond rapidly to fouling, which carries implications for the dynamics of mussel beds in their intertidal and subtidal habitats, especially in relation to movement of mussels within and among aggregations.},

	abstract = {An experimental artiﬁcial reef was constructed in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland as part of trials to regenerate damaged biogenic reefs formed by the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus. Experimental reef plots were constructed using Pecten maximus shell as cultch. Clumps of live adult M. modiolus were translocated from nearby natural reefs into cultch with a high proﬁle (elevated cultch), cultch with a low proﬁle (ﬂattened cultch), as well as directly into the seaﬂoor. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that translocated mussel clumps would increase habitat complexity thus accelerating community succession and enhancing natural recruitment of M. modiolus spat. These effects were predicted to be greater on elevated cultch due to greater protection from predators and increased accessibility to food resources. Within the artiﬁcial reef array the translocated clumps had a signiﬁcant positive effect on recruitment compared to cultch without mussels with average densities of spat settled on the translocated M. modiolus clumps ranging from 100 to 200 individuals m−2 compared to 4 to 52 spat m−2 on cultch without mussels. Recruitment of M. modiolus spat was also signiﬁcantly higher on translocated horse mussels when compared to natural reefs where densities of 8–36 spat m−2 were recorded. Reef elevation appeared to provide some degree of protection from predators but differences in translocated M. modiolus survival on the different elevation treatments were not signiﬁcant. In total, 223 taxa were recorded 12 months after reef construction. The presence of translocated clumps of M. modiolus was the main driver of the increases in faunal diversity and species abundance. Application of objective criteria to assess the performance of artiﬁcial reefs suggested that translocation of M. modiolus clumps alone achieved most of the restoration objectives. Consequently this pilot study demonstrates a straightforward and realistic intervention technique that could be used to kick start the regeneration and expansion of impacted mussel and similar biogenic reefs elsewhere.},

In Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) biogenic reefs cover only a fraction of their historical range with the remaining reefs badly damaged and requiring restoration. Previous experimental trials suggest that translocation of horse mussels accelerates reef recovery and has therefore been proposed as a suitable restoration technique. We used a series of coupled hydrodynamic and particle dispersal models to assess larval dispersion from remnant and translocated populations to identify suitable areas for adult live M. modiolus translocation in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. A maximum entropy model (MAXENT) was used to identify if dispersing larvae could reach habitat suitable for adult M. modiolus. From these we predicted if translocated mussels will reseed themselves or be able to act as larval sources for nearby reefs. The dispersal models showed that the remnant M. modiolus populations are largely self-recruiting with little connectivity between them. The majority of larvae settled near the sources and movement was largely dependent on the tides and not inﬂuenced by wind or waves. Higher reef elevation resulted in larvae being able to disperse further away from the release point. However, larval numbers away from the source population are likely to be too low for successful recruitment. There was also little connectivity between the Irish Sea and Strangford Lough as any larvae entering the Lough remained predominantly in the Strangford Narrows. The areas covered by these self-seeding populations are suitable for M. modiolus translocation according to the MAXENT model. As a result of this work and in conjunction with other ﬁeld work we propose a combination of total protection of all remaining larval sources and small scale translocations onto suitable substrata in each of the identiﬁed self-recruiting areas.},

	abstract = {The boreal bivalve Modiolus modiolus is common subtidally where it aggregates to form extensive, long-lived, biogenic habitats with a diverse associated flora and, especially, fauna. Despite this ecological importance, M. modiolus has not been described in terms of its functional morphology and overall biology. Modiolus modiolus is a typical epibenthic, suspensionfeeding mytilid, albeit with anatomical modifications adapting it to a partially buried, gregarious lifestyle in a stable environment experiencing medium–high energy levels. The juvenile shell is covered partly in byssal setae secreted by the byssal gland and foot complex and becomes covered in sand grains held in place by a mucoid cement secreted by the dorsal mantle. The camouflaged shell at this vulnerable time probably serves as an anti-predator device. Individuals grow to maximum shell lengths of ∼60–213 mm, depending on depth and locality. With age (≥ 20–45 years), shells often become deformed, particularly posteriorly and around the byssal gape, thereby increasing reproductive capacity (gonadal volume) without increasing somatic growth. Information on the biology, reproductive strategy and life history traits of M. modiolus are reviewed. These field- and laboratory-derived data provide us with essential information to aid future research into the protection and conservation of this ecologically important biogenic habitat. This is because, today, dredging and fishery activities using bottom-towed gear have seriously damaged several M. modiolus habitats with deleterious impacts on ecosystem functioning. Post-impact recovery times are slow and dependent on both local and mega-population distributions.},

	abstract = {This study describes the impact of the first passage of two types of bottom-towed fishing gear on rare protected shellfishreefs formed by the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.). One of the study sites was trawled and the other was scallopdredged. Divers collected HD video imagery of epifauna from quadrats at the two study sites and directed infaunal samples from one site. The total number of epifaunal organisms was significantly reduced following a single pass of a trawl (90\%) or scallop dredge (59\%), as was the diversity of the associated community and the total number of M. modiolus at the trawled site. At both sites declines in anthozoans, hydrozoans, bivalves, echinoderms and ascidians accounted for most of the change. A year later, no recovery was evident at the trawled site and significantly fewer infaunal taxa (polychaetes, malacostracans, bivalves and ophuroids) were recorded in the trawl track. The severity of the two types of impact reflected the undisturbed status of the habitats compared to previous studies. As a ‘priority habitat’ the nature of the impacts described on M. modiolus communities are important to the development of conservation management policy and indicators of condition in Marine Protected Areas (EU Habitats Directive) as well as indicators of ‘Good Environmental Status’ under the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Conservation managers are under pressure to support decisions with good quality evidence. Elsewhere, indirect studies have shown declines of M. modiolus biogenic communities in fishing grounds. However, given the protected status of the rare habitat, premeditated demonstration of direct impact is unethical or illegal in Marine Protected Areas. This study therefore provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact from fishing gear whilst at the same time reflecting on the dilemma of evidence-based conservation management.},

In this study, we evaluated the contribution of mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii, Mytilus edulis platensis, and Perna perna) to the benthic species richness of intertidal and shallow subtidal communities at Cerro Verde (Uruguay). We compared the richness of macro-benthic species between mussel-engineered patches and patches without mussels but dominated by algae or barnacles at a landscape scale (all samples), between tidal levels, and between sites distributed along a wave exposition gradient. Overall, we found a net increase in species richness in samples with mussels (35 species), in contrast to samples where mussels were naturally absent or scarce (27 species). The positive trend of the effect did not depend upon tidal level or wave exposition, but its magnitude varied between sites. Within sites, a signiﬁcant positive effect was detected only at the protected site. Within the musselengineered patches, the richness of all macro-faunal groups (total, sessile and mobile) was positively correlated with mussel abundance. This evidence indicates that the mussel beds studied here were important in maintaining species richness at the landscape-level, and highlights that beds of shelled bivalves should not be neglected as conservation targets in marine benthic environments.},

	abstract = {Biogenic reefs are an important component of aquatic ecosystems where they enhance biodiversity. These reefs are often established by dense aggregations of a single taxa and understanding the fundamental principles of biogenic reef formation is needed for their conservation and restoration. We tested whether substratum type and density affected the aggregation behaviour of two important biogenic-reef forming species, the horse mussel, Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758), and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758). First, we tested for effects of substratum type on mussel movement and aggregation behaviour by manipulating substrata available to mussels in mesocosms (three treatments: no sediment added, sediment added, sediment and shells added). Both mussel species moved less in treatments with sediment and with both sediment and shells present than when no sediment or shells were added and the percentage of these mussels that aggregated (clumps of two or more individuals) was lower when shells were present compared to treatments without shells, however, fewer M. modiolus attached to shells than M. edulis. There was no effect of different substratum type on patch complexity of either mussel species. In addition, motivated by our interest in the restoration of M. modiolus, we also tested experimentally whether the aggregation behaviour of M. modiolus was density-dependent. M. modiolus moved a similar distance in three density treatments (100, 200 and 300 mussels m−2), however, their aggregation rate appeared to be greater when mussel density was higher, suggesting that the encounter rate of individuals is an important factor for aggregation. M. modiolus also formed aggregations with a higher fractal dimension in the high and medium density treatments compared to lower density, suggesting that at higher density this increased patch complexity could further facilitate increased recruitment with the enhanced habitat available for settlement. These ﬁndings add to the growing evidence showing that adding dead shells to substratum to encourage M. modiolus restoration is not likely to be effective. Our ﬁndings suggest that mussel density is a more important driver for patch and subsequently reef formation. Moreover, two seemingly functionally similar mussel species showed some differences in their behaviour (e.g. attachment to shells). This highlights the importance of considering the speciﬁc ecology of a target species, such as M. modiolus, when designing restoration methods because information garnered from experimentation on an ostensibly similar species (e.g. M. edulis) may not be appropriate.},

Unfortunately, very little is known of hydrodynamic aspects of settlement in such habitats. Based on flow-tank experiments and theoretical considerations, we discuss hydrodynamic interference with settlement of larvae on protrudingbody habitats. We suggest that larvae may overcome these interferences by producing mucous threads up to 100 body lengths in size. These adhesive threads enable propagules of suspension feeders to settle in environments of high food-particle flux and low sedimentation rate. The results suggest that hydrodynamic impediments to encounter play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of benthic species on protruding bodies by favoring propagules of species with such adhesive devices.},

	abstract = {Sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus on Georges Bank in the northwest Atlantic exhibit semi-annual spawning phenology, where the autumn spawn is dominant and the spring spawn is smaller and more variable. The spring spawn is thought to contribute little to total annual larval settlement on the Bank because fecundity is lower, larval development is slower and off-Bank transport is higher during spring. We tested the hypothesis that larval settlement during spring is negligible compared to autumn by incorporating spatially and temporally explicit information about spawning and larval mortality into a coupled biological-physical larval tracking model to investigate dispersal and connectivity during each spawning period. To accomplish this, we assimilated field data on adult density-at-size and seasonal fecundity-at-size as initial conditions into the model. We discovered that larval production varied in time (spring production on the Bank is half that of autumn) and space (spawners are concentrated along the advective pathway of the along-Bank gyre). Particle settlement and connectivity was reduced, but not negligible, during spring compared to autumn due to stronger dispersal off-Bank and into uninhabitable areas during spring. When mortality was made constant in space and time, lower larval production combined with slower growth during spring resulted in a minimal contribution of the spring spawn to annual settlement. When mortality was correlated with environmental variation in time and space, the spring spawn contributed up to one-third of the total annual larval settlement between the immediate upstream-downstream connected aggregations. We conclude that the spring spawn can make a substantial contribution to total annual larval production, and that settlement on Georges Bank and should be given more attention in field studies. Larval mortality has a strong influence on settlement during spring and autumn, and future field studies should focus on quantifying space and time variation in mortality in relation to the environment.},

Analysts have then projected future water temperatures to forecast shifts in COG, but often neglected to demonstrate that temperature explains a substantial portion of historical distribution shifts. We argue that estimating the proportion of observed distributional shifts that can be attributed to temperature vs. other factors is a critical first step in forecasting future changes. We illustrate this approach using Gadus chalcogrammus (Walleye pollock) in the Eastern Bering Sea, and use a vector-autoregressive spatiotemporal model to attribute variation in COG from 1982 to 2015 to three factors: local or regional changes in surface and bottom temperature (“temperature effects”), fluctuations in size-structure that cause COG to be skewed towards juvenile or adult habitats (“size-structured effects”) or otherwise unexplained spatiotemporal variation in distribution (“unexplained effects”). We find that the majority of variation in COG (including the north-west trend since 1982) is largely unexplained by temperature or size-structured effects. Temperature alone generates a small portion of primarily north–south variation in COG, while size-structured effects generate a small portion of east–west variation. We therefore conclude that projections of future distribution based on temperature alone are likely to miss a substantial portion of both the interannual variation and interdecadal trends in COG for this species. More generally, we suggest that decomposing variation in COG into multiple causal factors is a vital first step for projecting likely impacts of temperature change.},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of nine Northwest Atlantic groundfish stocks was documented using spatial indicators based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data, 1963–2016. We then evaluated the relative importance of population size, fishing pressure and bottom temperature on spatial distribution with an information theoretic approach. Northward movement in the spring was generally consistent with prior analyses, whereas changes in depth distribution and area occupancy were not. Only two stocks exhibited the same changes in spatiotemporal distribution in the fall as compared with the spring. Fishing pressure was the most important predictor of the center of gravity (i.e., bivariate mean location of the population) for the majority of stocks in the spring, whereas in the fall this was restricted to the east-west component. Fishing pressure was also the most important predictor of the dispersion around the center of gravity in both spring and fall. In contrast, biomass was the most important predictor of area occupancy for the majority of stocks in both seasons. The relative importance of bottom temperature was ranked highest in the fewest number of cases. This study shows that fishing pressure, in addition to the previously established role of climate, influences the spatial distribution of groundfish in the Northwest Atlantic. More broadly, this study is one of a small but growing body of literature to demonstrate that fishing pressure has an effect on the spatial distribution of marine resources. Future work must consider both fishing pressure and climate when examining mechanisms underlying fish distribution shifts.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode ≈30\%). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

	abstract = {There is broad consensus that the main problem facing fisheries globally is too many boats chasing too few fish. Unfortunately it is also possible to argue that there are too many proposed solutions and not enough practical answers to improving fisheries management. There is a deepening divide between those who propose alternative regulatory controls on fishers, including establishing large areas permanently closed to fishing, and those who argue for better alignment of incentives combined with broad participation of resource users in fishery management decisions (in simple terms, between top down and bottom up systems of governance). However despite the choice of policy instruments used, a consistent outcome is that resource users behave in a manner that is often unintended by the designers of the management system. Hence whilst uncertainty is broadly recognized as a pervasive feature of fisheries management, to date most of the attention has focussed on only part of that uncertainty – scientific uncertainty about the status of exploited resources. The effect of uncertainty generated on the human side of fisheries science and management has received much less attention. However, the uncertainty generated by unexpected resource user behaviour is critical as it has unplanned consequences and leads to unintended management outcomes. Using empirical evidence of unexpected resource user behaviour and reviewing current responses to unexpected management outcomes, we identify different approaches that both improve prediction of human behaviour in fisheries systems and identify management measures that are more robust to these sources of uncertainty. However, unless the micro scale drivers of human behaviour that contribute to macro scale implementation uncertainty are communicated effectively to managers and considered more regularly and in greater depth, unanticipated responses to management actions will continue to undermine management systems and threaten the sustainability of fisheries.},

	abstract = {Georges Bank, a shallow submarine plateau located off the New England coast, has supported valuable commercial fisheries for several centuries. The region is characterized by high levels of primary productivity and, historically, high levels of fish production. Within the last four decades Georges Bank has been subjected to major perturbations that have profoundly altered levels of catch, abundance, and species composition. The arrival of distant water fleets during the early 1960s resulted in dramatic increases in effective fishing effort and the subsequent commercial collapse of several fish populations. Total fish biomass is estimated to have declined by {\textgreater}50\% on Georges Bank during the period of operation of the distant water fleets. The implementation of extended jurisdiction (the 200-mile [370.4-km] limit) in 1977 was followed by modernization and increased capacity of the domestic fleet, resulting in a second perturbation to the system that resulted in further declines in groundfish populations to historically low levels. A subsequent increase in the abundance of species of low commercial value was documented, with an apparent replacement of gadid and flounder species by small elasmobranchs (including dogfish sharks and skates). Examination of feeding guild structure suggests that this switch in species dominance may have been linked to a competitive release. The small elasmobranchs, notably dogfish sharks, also prey on species of commercial importance (primarily small pelagics, including herring and mackerel). The cumulative impacts on the groundfish populations as a result of intense exploitation and predation pressure may have been further exacerbated by effects of fishing gear on the physical structure of the habitat. Implications for the development of an ecosystem-based management approach are described.},

However, their limitations are evident from continuing declines in fish stocks throughout the world. We make the case that to reverse fishery declines, safeguard marine life and sustain ecosystem processes, extensive marine reserves that are off limits to fishing must become part of the management strategy. Marine reserves should be incorporated into modern fishery management because they can achieve many things that conventional tools cannot. Only complete and permanent protection from fishing can protect the most sensitive habitats and vulnerable species. Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management failure, including risk–prone quota setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it.},

	abstract = {1 The much needed protection of European commercial fish, and their fisheries, cannot in general be achieved through technical measures, such as closed areas and mesh sizes, alone. Their conservation requires permanent reductions in fishing mortality, which means that less fish must be killed. 2 Models have been developed that allow the quantitative evaluation of the long-term effects of closing areas to fishing on mature biomass and yields of exploited fish populations. The models need information on the demographic biology of the fish, the behaviour of the fishermen and the management system. They assume a quality of data that are available from European marine fisheries. 3 A ‘rule of thumb’ is given to indicate the relative effects on mature biomass of reductions in juvenile and adult fishing mortality. For most exploited fish populations the mature stock would benefit more from proportional reductions in juvenile mortality. 4 Permanent closures of nursery areas, in which there are high discards of juvenile fish, will assist in increasing the size of the mature stock, and will often increase yields to the fishery. In contrast, the closures of spawning grounds can be counterproductive. 5 For fisheries managed by quotas, a displacement of the fleet from one locality to another, where the same population is fished, will generally have little effect if the same quota is taken. 6 Closed areas may also be beneficial to unregulated fisheries, or those managed by effort, if fishing is displaced from areas of high catch rates causing less fish to be killed. Benefits are also likely where closed areas can supply a significant recruitment to adjacent areas, or where they can give protection to vulnerable species or habitats. 7 3More generally, it is possible to evaluate the short- and long-term effects on fish yield and mature biomass of closed areas. The results will be sensitive to the biology of the fish, particularly its population identity, distribution, migration and recruitment, the intensity of fishing, the behaviour of the fisherman, and the other management systems in place. Specific analyses are needed in most cases. 8. Many commercial and non-commercial fish spawn on the Trevose fishing grounds off north Cornwall. New material shows the time and location of spawning. Closure of the commercial fishery over spring will not benefit the species regulated by quota if the fish are caught elsewhere. However, a closure is likely to benefit the many other non-commercial and unregulated species that are caught in the area.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recovery of depleted populations is fundamentally important for conservation biology and sustainable resource harvesting. At low abundance, population growth rate, a primary determinant of population recovery, is generally assumed to be relatively fast because competition is low (i.e., negative density dependence). But population growth can be limited in small populations by an Allee effect. This is particularly relevant for collapsed populations or species that have not recovered despite large reductions in, or elimination of, threats. We investigated how an Allee effect can influence the dynamics of recovery. We used Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) as the study organism and an empirically quantified Allee effect for the species to parameterize our simulations. We simulated recovery through an individual-based mechanistic simulation model and then compared recovery among scenarios incorporating an Allee effect, negative density dependence, and an intermediate scenario. Although an Allee effect significantly slowed recovery, such that population increase could be negligible even after 100 years or more, it also made the time required for biomass rebuilding much less predictable. Our finding that an Allee effect greatly increased the uncertainty in recovery time frames provides an empirically based explanation for why the removal of threat does not always result in the recovery of depleted populations or species.

	abstract = {The forest floor in many ecosystems consists of a partially decomposed organic layer (duff), which together with the litter layer comprises the boundary between the atmosphere and the mineral soil. Processes controlling the duff water budget during dry periods (which occur during most of the summer) were investigated using field monitoring, field flow exclusion manipulations, and coupled, multiphasic water and heat budget modeling. The objective of this paper is to model the significant processes that govern the dynamics of the duff water budget during drying. During dry periods the moisture content of the duff's F layer cycles diurnally with minimal moisture movement between the duff and mineral soil. Field exclusion of dew, lateral flow, and mineral soil flow suggests that diurnal drying cycles during the dry period are driven by diurnal atmospheric energy fluxes leading to coupled heat and mass fluxes within the duff. The fine root system and lateral flow do not typically influence drying. TOUGH2 was used to develop a one-dimensional, multiphasic (both liquid and vapor) coupled water and heat budget model which confirmed that the vertical moisture fluxes lead to diurnal cycles. The model reproduced duff drying patterns with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies and R2 values greater than 0.910 and 0.970, respectively. Wavelet analysis indicates that the model and observed diurnal cycles in the upper layer's moisture contents are correlated at the 24 h scale. A model flux analysis reveals that lateral fluxes smaller than approximately 360 mm3 h?1 would have little influence on the pattern of drying in the duff layer. Fluxes larger than approximately 5\% of the total evaporative flux would slow duff drying and lead to behavior not observed in the field.},

These definitional inconsistencies result in global ad hoc attempts at recovery and recovery plans that typically exhibit low success rates, and whose outcomes are difficult to evaluate. There is a dire need for an internationally accepted framework to guide the development of plans for the recovery of populations, species, and ecosystems. Such a framework must distinguish between the process of recovery and the end-state of recovered, and implement quantifiable, generalizable guidelines that ensure optimal outcomes. Drawing from established principles in medicine, we introduce a 5-stage classification of recovery: Diagnosis, Treatment, Stabilization, Rehabilitation, and Recovered. Recovery and recovered states should be measured objectively, using population health metrics relevant to the life history of the population, organism, or ecological unit under consideration. These metrics should be used to establish a baseline, set targets for a recovered state, and monitor population health in accordance with the five stages of recovery. This framework could be used to overcome significant problems of unpredictable decision making, definitional inconsistencies, and an inability to measure recovery or learn from failures and successes. The guidelines we propose are intended for adoption by conservation agencies, and provide a quantified, accountable system that could greatly improve the likelihood of populations successfully reaching recovered status.},

	abstract = {Many elasmobranchs have experienced strong population declines, which have been largely attributed to the direct and indirect effects of exploitation. Recently, however, live elasmobranchs are being increasingly valued for their role in marine ecosystems, dive tourism and intrinsic worth. Thus, management plans have been implemented to slow and ultimately reverse negative trends, including shark-specific (e.g. anti-finning laws) to ecosystem-based (e.g. no-take marine reserves) strategies. Yet it is unclear how successful these measures are, or will be, given the degree of depletion and slow recovery potential of most elasmobranchs. Here, current understanding of elasmobranch population recoveries is reviewed. The potential and realized extent of population increases, including rates of increase, timelines and drivers are evaluated. Across 40 increasing populations, only 25\% were attributed to decreased anthropogenic mortality, while the majority was attributed to predation release. It is also shown that even low exploitation rates (2?6\% per year) can halt or reverse positive population trends in six populations currently managed under recovery plans. Management measures that help restore elasmobranch populations include enforcement or near-zero fishing mortality, protection of critical habitats, monitoring and education. These measures are highlighted in a case study from the south-eastern U.S.A., where some evidence of recovery is seen in Pristis pectinata, Galeocerdo cuvier and Sphyrna lewini populations. It is concluded that recovery of elasmobranchs is certainly possible but requires time and a combination of strong and dedicated management actions to be successful.},

Here we use both empirical data and a three-dimensional coupled heat and water budget model to explain the duff hydrological hillslope shift between very brief wet periods when lateral flow in the duff and infiltration into the mineral soil occur and dry periods when evaporative flow dominates and both lateral and mineral soil flow are not important. The duff moisture transitions from wet to dry periods were the result of low lateral flow which moves liquid and water vapour only centimetres to metres, very rapidly and mostly in the H layer immediately after precipitation. During wet periods, the net lateral fluxes were negative on divergent areas and positive on convergent areas of the hillslope, leading to a net moisture loss in divergent areas and a net gain in convergent areas. The response to lateral flow in the H layer was more rapid than in the F layer. The transition from the lateral downwards flow to mineral soil to evaporative control was within approximately 48 h of precipitation. Canopy species and aspect were important with lodgepole pine, southwest aspect and 4-cm deep duff controlled by evaporative processes while Engelmann spruce, northeast aspect and 30-cm duff were more controlled by hillslope redistribution processes.

	abstract = {Fuel moisture plays an important role in predicting wildfire spread rates, fuel consumption, and heat output. The purpose of this study was to find how much we can simplify an F and H layer moisture model by comparing an empirical-phenomenalistic drying model with a mechanistic waterbudget that included all of the major water fluxes. Traditionally, fuel moisture has been calculated using phenomenalistic exponential drying rate models, which use standard meteorological station variables (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, day length, and others). First, wereport on comparisons between field-measured F and H soil layer moisture and moisture estimates based on the Duff Moisture Code and Drought Code of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) in Pinus contorta and Picea engelmannii forests during dry and wet years. Next, anF and H layer water budget is used to understand possible reasons for the differences between the Duff Moisture Code, the Drought Code, and the moisture measured in the field. For the pine forest, the Duff Moisture Code was a good estimate of the F layer moisture during and shortly after precipitationevents in both the dry and wet years but underestimated moisture when duff was drying. The pine Drought Code underestimated the H layer moisture in the dry year and overestimated it in the wet year. For the spruce forest, in the dry year the Duff Moisture Code overestimated the moisture duringand after precipitation and underestimated it in dry periods. However, in the wet year, the code overestimated moisture most of the time. The spruce Drought Code underestimated the moisture content in both the wet and dry years. Results from the water budget model suggest that the differencein the F layer moisture between the field measurements and both the Drought Code and Duff Moisture Code is due to the lack of coupling of water flow between the F and H layers in the codes. In particular, the diurnal water movement from the H to F layer during the drying part of the seasonis integral to the water budget. To improve predictions based on the fuel moisture codes, coupled water and heat budgets along with the hydrologic properties of the F and H layers should be incorporated into the codes to enable more accurate prediction of duff moisture and calibration fordifferent types of duff.},

The loss of larger, older fish has been hypothesized to negatively affect metrics of population viability, such as spawning behaviour, recruitment, and adult survival. Most studies to date have focussed on individual stocks. Here, we examine trends in average age and weight at broad taxonomic and temporal scales, using subsets of data compiled on 95 marine fish stocks. Following moderate declines between 1960 and 1990, we find that the average age has generally increased since 2000, such that 71\% of 69 stocks are currently above their long-term average. However, the size of the oldest individuals has generally declined over time; the average weight is currently below average in 75\% of 55 stocks. A temporal decline in the mean weight of the youngest constituents within 49 stocks is most evident in the Clupeiformes. Our results indicate that recovery of age structure need not be accompanied by recovery of weights-at-age, evidenced in part by a decline in the size of the oldest individuals within populations. Further study into the drivers of these patterns, and the consequences of declining weights-at-age for population viability, is warranted.},

	abstract = {Exploited fish populations frequently exhibit truncated age-structure. To address a basic question in fisheries science and conservation biology—how does age truncation affect population dynamics and productivity?—we explored the effect of age-structure on recruitment dynamics of ten stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Based on six alternative stock–recruitment relationships, we compared models that included and excluded maternal age-structure effects on recruitment. In all ten stocks, a recruitment model that included a maternal age-dependent effect was preferred over the standard Ricker model and in seven of the ten stocks, the preferred statistical model included a positive effect of either maternal age or mass on recruitment. Simulations comparing standard and maternal age dependent recruitment two decades into the future suggest that the inclusion of maternal age in recruitment models has little effect on projected biomasses. However, this similarity in biomass trajectory masked an increased sensitivity of populations with maternal age-dependent recruitment to stock age-structure. In particular, simulations with maternal age-dependent recruitment responded strongly to changes in fishing mortality on the oldest age classes, while simulations using standard recruitment models did not. Populations with maternal age-dependent recruitment can exhibit increased biomass catch even if fishing mortality on older individuals was reduced. Overall, simulations suggested that the influence of maternal age on population dynamics are more nuanced than suggested by previous research and indicate that careful consideration of the effects of age-structure on populations may lead to substantially different fisheries management reference points—particularly with respect to age-specific fishing mortality—than classical models. While these results suggest a link between maternal age and population productivity, future research requires the incorporation of biologically reasonable and empirically defensible mechanisms to clarify the effect of age on population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Captive-breeding programs can be implemented to preserve the genetic diversity of endangered populations such that the controlled release of captive-bred individuals into the wild may promote recovery. A common difficulty, however, is that programs are founded with limited wild broodstock, and inbreeding can become increasingly difficult to avoid with successive generations in captivity. Program managers must choose between maintaining the genetic purity of populations, at the risk of inbreeding depression, or interbreeding populations, at the risk of outbreeding depression. We evaluate these relative risks in a captive-breeding program for 3 endangered populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In each of 2 years, we released juvenile F1 and F2 interpopulation hybrids, backcrosses, as well as inbred and noninbred within-population crosstypes into 9 wild streams. Juvenile size and survival was quantified in each year. Few crosstype effects were observed, but interestingly, the relative fitness consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding varied from year to year. Temporal variation in environmental quality might have driven some of these annual differences, by exacerbating the importance of maternal effects on juvenile fitness in a year of low environmental quality and by affecting the severity of inbreeding depression differently in different years. Nonetheless, inbreeding was more consistently associated with a negative effect on fitness, whereas the consequences of outbreeding were less predictable. Considering the challenges associated with a sound risk assessment in the wild and given that the effect of inbreeding on fitness is relatively predictable, we suggest that risk can be weighted more strongly in terms of the probable outcome of outbreeding. Factors such as genetic similarities between populations and the number of generations in isolation can sometimes be used to assess outbreeding risk, in lieu of experimentation.

	abstract = {Independent of the effects of spawning-stock biomass (SSB), environmental variability in juvenile production, driven by factors such as temperature and food supply, have considerable potential to influence population resilience to fishing and depletion. Here, we analyse 18 time-series of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks and empirically estimate this “environmental variability” in recruit-per-spawner (RPS) ratios. We then investigate the role of environmental recruitment variability on population resilience to fishing and ability to recover following depletion. To this end, cod population dynamics are simulated through a period of fishing, followed by a period of recovery, with alternative scenarios of recruitment variability and autocorrelation within it. The major effect of environmental recruitment variability is manifested through uncertainty. Firstly, the higher the recruitment variability, the shorter and less variable the time required for the population to decline below 15\% of its carrying capacity, K. Secondly, higher variability leads to higher uncertainty in recovery time. Both these patterns are further strengthened by autocorrelation. Our findings suggest that increased environmental recruitment variability decreases resilience to fishing and increases uncertainty in recovery, thus challenging some traditional views that variability confers high productivity and rapid ability to recover from collapse.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world “fishing the line” is a frequent harvesting tactic in communities where no-take marine reserves are designated. This practice of concentrating fishing effort at the boundary of a marine reserve is predicated upon the principle of spillover, the net export of stock from the marine reserve to the surrounding unprotected waters. We explore the consequences and optimality of fishing the line using a spatially explicit theoretical model. We show that fishing the line: (1) is part of the optimal effort distribution near no-take marine reserves with mobile species regardless of the cooperation level among harvesters; (2) has a significant impact on the spatial patterns of catch per unit effort (CPUE) and fish density both within and outside of the reserve; and (3) can enhance total population size and catch simultaneously under a limited set of conditions for overexploited populations. Additionally, we explore the consequences of basing the spatial distribution of fishing effort for a multispecies fishery upon the optimality of the most mobile species that exhibits the greatest spillover. Our results show that the intensity of effort allocated to fishing the line should instead be based upon more intermediate rates of mobility within the targeted community. We conclude with a comparison between model predictions and empirical findings from a density gradient study of two important game fish in the vicinity of a no-take marine-life refuge on Santa Catalina Island, California (USA). These results reveal the need for empirical studies to account for harvester behavior and suggest that the implications of spatial discontinuities such as fishing the line should be incorporated into marine-reserve design.},

	abstract = {Seafood is an essential source of protein for more than 3 billion people worldwide, yet bycatch of threatened species in capture fisheries remains a major impediment to fisheries sustainability. Management measures designed to reduce bycatch often result in significant economic losses and even fisheries closures. Static spatial management approaches can also be rendered ineffective by environmental variability and climate change, as productive habitats shift and introduce new interactions between human activities and protected species. We introduce a new multispecies and dynamic approach that uses daily satellite data to track ocean features and aligns scales of management, species movement, and fisheries. To accomplish this, we create species distribution models for one target species and three bycatch-sensitive species using both satellite telemetry and fisheries observer data. We then integrate species-specific probabilities of occurrence into a single predictive surface, weighing the contribution of each species by management concern. We find that dynamic closures could be 2 to 10 times smaller than existing static closures while still providing adequate protection of endangered nontarget species. Our results highlight the opportunity to implement near real-time management strategies that would both support economically viable fisheries and meet mandated conservation objectives in the face of changing ocean conditions. With recent advances in eco-informatics, dynamic management provides a new climate-ready approach to support sustainable fisheries.
Dynamic management approaches protect endangered bycatch species but with much greater efficiency than existing static closures.

	abstract = {Dynamic management (DM) is a novel approach to spatial management that aligns scales of environmental variability, animal movement and human uses. While static approaches to spatial management rely on one-time assessments of biological, environmental, economic, and/or social conditions, dynamic approaches repeatedly assess conditions to produce regularly updated management recommendations. Owing to this complexity, particularly regarding operational challenges, examples of applied DM are rare. To implement DM, scientific methodologies are operationalized into tools, i.e., self-contained workflows that run automatically at a prescribed temporal frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Here we present a start-to-finish framework for operationalizing DM tools, consisting of four stages: Acquisition, Prediction, Dissemination, and Automation. We illustrate this operationalization framework using an applied DM tool as a case study. Our DM tool operates in near real-time and was designed to maximize target catch and minimize bycatch of non-target and protected species in a US-based commercial fishery. It is important to quantify the sensitivity of DM tools to missing data, because dissemination streams for observed (i.e., remotely sensed or directly sampled) data can experience delays or gaps. To address this issue, we perform a detailed example sensitivity analysis using our case study tool. Synthesis and applications. Dynamic management (DM) tools are emerging as viable management solutions to accommodate the biological, environmental, economic, and social variability in our fundamentally dynamic world. Our four-stage operationalization framework and case study can facilitate the implementation of DM tools for a wide array of resource and disturbance management objectives.},

	abstract = {Most spatial marine management techniques (e.g., marine protected areas) draw stationary boundaries around often mobile marine features, animals, or resource users. While these approaches can work for relatively stationary marine resources, to be most effective marine management must be as fluid in space and time as the resources and users we aim to manage. Instead, a shift towards dynamic ocean management is suggested, defined as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data. Dynamic management can refine the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better balancing ecological and economic objectives. Temperature dependent habitat of a hypothetical mobile marine species was simulated to show the efficiency of dynamic management, finding that 82.0 to 34.2 percent less area needed to be managed using a dynamic approach. Dynamic management further complements existing management by increasing the speed at which decisions are implemented using predefined protocols. With advances in data collection and sharing, particularly in remote sensing, animal tracking, and mobile technology, managers are poised to apply dynamic management across numerous marine sectors. Existing examples demonstrate that dynamic management can successfully allow managers to respond rapidly to changes on-the-water, however to implement dynamic ocean management widely, several gaps must be filled. These include enhancing legal instruments, incorporating ecological and socioeconomic considerations simultaneously, developing ‘out-of-the-box’ platforms to serve dynamic management data to users, and developing applications broadly across additional marine resource sectors.},

In the present study, we investigated the physical and biological drivers of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasi), which is a marine forage fish species important for commercial fisheries and First Nations in the northeastern Pacific. We fit multivariate spatio-temporal models to fisheries-independent trawl- and acoustics-based data collected off the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI), Canada, during summers over the period 2006–2014. We evaluated the effects of the main ocean environmental drivers of WCVI lower trophic level productivity, including sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a, fluorescence, salinity, oxygen, transmissivity and zooplankton density on variation in Pacific Herring biomass. Models were also used to measure spatio-temporal covariation with other pelagic, semi-pelagic, and bottom-associated fish species occurring off the WCVI to address potential competitive and predation interactions. Through application of these spatio-temporal models we found: (i) Pacific Herring biomass off the WCVI increased during 2006–2014; the highest Pacific Herring biomass was repeatedly found on the continental shelf (depths {\textless} 185 m) while low densities were usually observed along the shelf break (depths {\textgreater} 185 m), where Euphausiids, Pacific Hake, Sablefish and Arrowtooth Flounder were more abundant, which could reflect predation avoidance behaviour; (ii), the local biomass of Pacific Herring was related quadratically to the average SST in May; (iii) a positive covariation in spatio-temporal densities between Pacific Herring and its common zooplankton prey, supporting a potential bottom-up control hypothesis; (iv) a negative covariation in spatio-temporal densities between Pacific Herring and both Pacific Hake and Pacific Sardine, which could reflect predation and competitive interactions, respectively; and (v) a positive covariation in spatio-temporal densities between Pacific Herring and several groundfish species (i.e., Arrowtooth Flounder, Sablefish, Pacific Halibut, Pacific Cod), which highlights the need for an accurate assessment of the relative contribution of those species to the total summer predation pressure experienced by Pacific Herring off the WCVI.

This factor is used in fisheries science to adjust for the gradual increase in the effectiveness of fishing gear resulting from the successive introduction of technological improvement to fishing gear and vessels. Altogether, 51 estimates of this creep factor, mostly around 2–4\%/yr and covering periods from 4 to 129 yr, were assembled or newly calculated from secondary data and shown to decrease as the period covered increased. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that creep factors are usually estimated and published to correct for the introduction of an effective new technology over a short period of time. We suggest that estimates obtained in this fashion cannot be applied to long-term analyses and propose instead our empirical relationship, derived from estimates of creep factor and the number of years covered in a study. Also, our study confirms that technology creep must be included in all analyses involving time series of fishing effort, particularly if they exceed one decade in temporal coverage.},

Such models are often fitted within a Bayesian framework requiring both the specification of prior distributions for model parameters and simulation-based approaches for inference. Here we present a frequentist framework as a viable alternative and recommend using the Laplace approximation with automatic differentiation, as implemented in the R package Template Model Builder, for fast fitting and reliable inference. Additionally we highlight some identifiability issues associated with SSMs that fisheries scientists should be aware of and demonstrate how our modelling strategy surmounts these problems.

The authors present maximum-likelihood regression models assuming that the dependent variable is conditionally beta distributed rather than Gaussian. The approach models both means (location) and variances (dispersion) with their own distinct sets of predictors (continuous and/or categorical), thereby modeling heteroscedasticity. The location sub-model link function is the logit and thereby analogous to logistic regression, whereas the dispersion sub-model is log linear. Real examples show that these models handle the independent observations case readily.

Sea scallop densities ranged from 0.25 to 0.59 scallops/m2 within the three surveyed areas and from 0.58 to 1.06 scallops/m2 at stations where at least 1 scallop was observed. Sea scallops were highly aggregated into patches (beds) on the scale of square kilometers, and the distribution was strongly associated with the distribution of coarse sand-granule-pebble substrate. The three areas surveyed (1,938 km2) contained approximately 650 million scallops representing 17 million kg of harvestable scallop meats. This is equivalent to 54\% of the average harvestable scallop meat biomass from 1977 to 1988. The area surveyed covered 5\% of the total scallop fishing grounds of Georges Bank. The video survey technique has several advantages over dredge surveys: it is fast, accurate, and precise and provides information on the biology of scallops and the associated habitat without disturbing the sea floor.},

Designing time-area closures that are predicted to achieve management goals under multiple spatial patterns of effort redistribution will increase chances of success. Using data from an estuarine gill net fishery, we tested if there are time-area closures predicted to reduce bycatch of two protected species groups while maintaining target catch under four simulated effort redistribution patterns. We found that the pattern of effort redistribution had a substantial impact on the amount of predicted bycatch in each closure scenario. Multiple closures were predicted to reduce bycatch of these species under all four simulations of effort redistribution. However, some combinations of closure and effort redistribution pattern resulted in estimated bycatch being higher than without a closure. We did not find any time-area closures that resulted in a predicted reduction in bycatch while maintaining target catch at original levels. We demonstrate a simple way for fisheries managers to account for the uncertainty in fishers' behavior by designing time-area closures that are predicted to reduce bycatch under multiple potential patterns of spatial redistribution of fishing effort.},

In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multi-species size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as Essential Ocean Variables by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), had lower performance for evaluating fishing impacts, yet they were most sensitive to changes in primary productivity. The indicator B/C was most sensitive to low levels of fishing pressure with a generally consistent threshold response around 0.4*FMSY (fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield) across nine of the ten ecosystems. Over 50\% of the 14 indicators had threshold responses at, or below ∼0.6* FMSY for most ecosystems, indicating that these ecosystems would have already crossed a threshold for most indicators when fished at FMSY. This research provides useful insights on the performance of indicators, which contribute to facilitating the worldwide move toward EBFM.},

The combined impacts of such ecosystem processes and fisheries have lead to stock collapses across the world. While traditional fisheries management focuses on harvest rates and stock biomass, incorporating the impacts of such ecosystem processes are one of the main pillars of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Although EAFM has been formally adopted widely since the 1990s, little is currently known to what extent ecosystem drivers of fish stock productivity are actually implemented in fisheries management. Based on worldwide review of more than 1200 marine fish stocks, we found that such ecosystem drivers were implemented in the tactical management of only 24 stocks. Most of these cases were in the North Atlantic and north-east Pacific, where the scientific support is strong. However, the diversity of ecosystem drivers implemented, and in the approaches taken, suggests that implementation is largely a bottom-up process driven by a few dedicated experts. Our results demonstrate that tactical fisheries management is still predominantly single-species oriented taking little account of ecosystem processes, implicitly ignoring that fish stock production is dependent on the physical and biological conditions of the ecosystem. Thus, while the ecosystem approach is highlighted in policy, key aspects of it tend yet not to be implemented in actual fisheries management.},

However, institutional, capacity, and budget constraints within U.S. federal and state fisheries management agencies may hinder the potential to deliver climate-ready strategies for many fisheries. We examine whether adaptive comanagement as a governance approach can enhance capacity and advance climate-ready fisheries objectives. Adaptive comanagement may improve the quality of science and decision-making needed to prepare for and respond to impacts of climate change in fisheries by taking advantage of skills, technology, and funding often not optimally utilized under the current governance system. We focus on the potential to improve information flows as a means to achieve climate-ready fisheries via adaptive comanagement, but suggest that a greater level of partnership in the management process may be possible in the future after a period of formal experimentation and learning.},

	abstract = {Many studies on the biology of bivalves have focused on identifying the importance of various environmental factors in regulating feeding behaviour in order to predict ingestion and growth responses in a variety of habitats. When taking into consideration the diversity of studies undertaken and the variety of methodologies employed, it is perhaps not surprising that there have been inconsistencies in both interspecific and intraspecific comparisons. In order to compare and contrast the way in which feeding activities of a mussel species (Mytilus edulis) and a scallop species (Placopecten magellanicus) respond to environmental factors and seston characteristics, we exposed both species simultaneously to a fluctuating assemblage of natural particles found in their local environment. Similar sizes of mussels (40–73 mm) and scallops (40–88 mm) were held in flow through chambers at two different sites in Atlantic Canada on four separate occasions, during which environmental conditions, including seston characteristics, were monitored and individual clearance rates were measured. Because the same individuals were measured over time, repeated-measures statistical procedures were used to analyze the data. Results indicate that weight standardized clearance rates of mussels were significantly higher than those of scallops only at the highest concentration tested (12.8 mg l−1), which translates into almost 3 times more material being filtered. Scallops appeared to respond to fluctuations in environment parameters and suspended food particles more consistently than mussels. These data suggest that the feeding behaviour of these two species is mediated differently by the same environmental parameters. Our study also demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate statistical tests (e.g., repeated measures) for the analyses of data obtained from repeated sampling of the same individuals over time, and the need to consider species-specific feeding responses when developing models that predict the influence of bivalve feeding on ecosystem function.},

We use a bio-economic approach to demonstrate that compensatory mitigation – an innovative, market-influenced approach to fishery–conservation conflicts – can facilitate high-value uses of biological resources and cost-effective conservation gains for species of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more effective from a return-on-investment perspective (ie percent increase in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries closures, and is more socio-politically feasible. A bycatch levy, which would increase with endangerment, provides an individual incentive for avoiding bycatch, the most effective mechanism for sustainable management of fisheries. Compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity to address a global concern, optimize conservation interventions, and forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations.},

	abstract = {Spatial fishery closures will induce fishing effort to either move to open areas or to cease to fish. When designing a short- or long-term closed area management regime, the expected impact of that closure will depend upon how that effort is redistributed. We present a redistribution model based upon Ideal Free Distributions (IFDs) which is intermediate in complexity between analyses in which effort is distributed uniformly over open areas and models of full fleet dynamics. The IFD models incorporate the fundamentals of the decision process invoked by fishers facing relocation and the ensuing catch rates that result from the addition or removal of effort. Two classes of models were tested: an Availability model where catch rate declines were proportional to abundance; and an Abundance model where abundance declines at an exponential rate with the entry of displaced effort into an area. Results of these models were compared with uniform and proportional redistribution methods. The IFD-based methods included relative cost of relocation, thereby illustrating the importance of both catch rates and movement costs in designing closed area regulations. To demonstrate the methods, hypothetical area closures to United States pelagic longliners in the western Atlantic were examined and the impact of those closures on bycatch rates was evaluated. Guidance for selecting an appropriate model structure for a particular closed area problem is given.},

	abstract = {Discard reduction is a component of the statutory requirements of the Sustainable Fisheries Act. One species of concern is scup, Stenotomus chrysops, discarded in the Loligo pealei fishery. Initially, regulations were imposed restricting the fishery in time and space to avoid areas and times associated with high scup discarding. Modified gear was required in 2003 on any boat fishing in areas otherwise closed to the fishery to reduce scup discarding. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of the 2003 net regulations and the potential influence of time–area closures (GRAs) in achieving a reduction in scup discarding. The regulations are based on three expectations. (1) Reduction in discarding in the Loligo squid fishery will materially reduce total scup discarding. (2) Exclusion of Loligo squid fishing vessels from the GRAs will result in these vessels fishing in areas that inherently produce fewer scup discards without equivalently increasing discarding in other sensitive species. (3) The use of a square-mesh large-mesh section in the extension will reduce scup discarding to the extent that otherwise would be achieved if the boats fished outside the GRAs without the economic cost imposed by redeploying the fleet. Analysis of the NMFS-NEFSC observer database offers no support for the belief that Expectation 1 has been met. Squid catches were too low to sustain a directed fishery in the northern GRA during this study. Thus, had this area been open, limited scup discarding would have occurred. In this study, squid catches averaged 1025kgtow−1 in the southern GRA. Thus, had the GRA been open, Loligo fishing would have taken place. Yet, in the 34 tows taken by two vessels, not a single scup was caught. Redeployment of the fleet clearly increased scup discarding in 2003. Thus, Expectation 2 was not met. Field tests demonstrated that the implemented net modification can produce reduced catches of mostly smaller-sized finfish without impairing squid catch, but the data also indicate that this result may not be routinely achieved. Thus, Expectation 3 was not completely met. Implementation of the 2003 net regulation was likely premature, in that the specification was not adequate to guarantee the desired results. The history of the scup discarding issue in the Loligo squid fishery demonstrates that discard reduction cannot be accomplished without adequate prior evaluation of the sources of discards, without the requisite and concomitant experimental evaluation of the results of regulatory reform, and without adequate commercial-scale testing of prospective reforms prior to implementation.},

	abstract = {Southern bluefin tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii (Castelnau), is a quota-managed species that makes annual winter migrations to the Tasman Sea off south-eastern Australia. During this period it interacts with a year-round tropical tuna longline fishery (Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery, ETBF). ETBF managers seek to minimise the bycatch of SBT by commercial ETBF longline fishers with limited or no SBT quota through spatial restrictions. Access to areas where SBT are believed to be present is restricted to fishers holding SBT quota. A temperature-based SBT habitat model was developed to provide managers with an estimate of tuna distribution upon which to base their decisions about placement of management boundaries. Adult SBT temperature preferences were determined using pop-up satellite archival tags. The near real-time predicted location of SBT was determined by matching temperature preferences to satellite sea surface temperature data and vertical temperature data from an oceanographic model. Regular reports detailing the location of temperature-based SBT habitat were produced during the period of the ETBF fishing season when interactions with SBT occur. The SBT habitat model included: (i) predictions based on the current vertical structure of the ocean; (ii) seasonally adjusted temperature preference data for the 60 calendar days centred on the prediction date; and (iii) development of a temperature-based SBT habitat climatology that allowed visualisation of the expected change in the distribution of the SBT habitat zones throughout the season. At the conclusion of the fishing season an automated method for placing management boundaries was compared with the subjective approach used by managers. Applying this automated procedure to the habitat predictions enabled an investigation of the effects of setting management boundaries using old data and updating management boundaries infrequently. Direct comparison with the management boundaries allowed an evaluation of the efficiency and biases produced by this aspect of the fishery management process. Near real-time fishery management continues to be a realistic prospect that new scientific approaches using novel tools can support and advance.},

Fisheries managers shifting from a target species focus to an ecosystem-based approach are being required to consider the impact of fisheries on non-target species. There are a range of complementary management tools that help reduce bycatch, such as gear restrictions, temporal restrictions, and bycatch reduction devices. One management approach that is increasingly being considered is fisheries closures. We tested the utility of 3 closure approaches for the improved protection of bycatch species in the South African pelagic longline fishery. As there was some variation where and when different groups of bycatch species were caught, we found that temporary spatial closures were the most effective strategy for both protecting bycatch and minimizing the cost to fishers. This is logical because having mobile closures in space and time provides more flexibility than permanent spatial closures or seasonal closures. However these benefits need to be traded off against the costs and problems of implementing temporary spatial closures. Of the 2 sub-optimal strategies, we discovered that seasonal closures are significantly less effective than spatial closures.},

This problem formed the basis to a risk-assessment study aimed at quantifying the risks to Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) and New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) populations from bycatch in a trap (rock lobster) and demersal gillnet fishery off South Australia. The approach was to: (1) estimate the spatial distribution of foraging effort for different sex and age classes within each species; (2) compare these with the spatial distribution of fishing effort in order to develop spatial estimates of seal-fishery interaction probabilities; (3) undertake population viability analyses to identify the levels of bycatch that would place subpopulations of each species into different risk categories; and (4) examine different bycatch scenarios and identify subpopulations, regions and marine fishing areas with the greatest bycatch risk. Results suggest that the risk of subpopulation extinction, even from low levels of bycatch, was high for sea lions, but very low for fur seals and that the two fisheries lend themselves to different mitigation approaches: gear modification in the lobster fishery, and spatial management of fishing effort in the demersal gillnet fishery.},

	abstract = {Bycatch of unwanted, prohibited, or protected species is a problem in most commercial fisheries. Trawl fisheries are particularly prone to bycatch problems because trawls are not species-selective. In this paper, I review the history of finfish bycatch research in the Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery and explore the use of quotas to reduce finfish bycatch by examining four fisheries that currently use bycatch quotas: (1) the arrow squid trawl fishery of New Zealand, which uses fleet bycatch quotas for sea lion bycatch, (2) the Alaskan groundfish trawl fisheries, which use fleet quotas under a “vessel incentive program” for prohibited species, (3) the groundfish trawl fishery of British Columbia, Canada which uses individual vessel bycatch quotas for prohibited species, and (4) the multi-species trawl fisheries of New Zealand, which use catch balancing, or individual transferable quotas, for most commercially landed species. Based on the bycatch quota experiences in these fisheries, elements of successful bycatch quota programs include: (1) individual accountability, in the form of individual or cooperative bycatch quotas, rather than fleet quotas, (2) 100\% observer coverage, (3) relatively small, manageable fleets, (4) limited landing ports that can be easily monitored, particularly if observer coverage is incomplete, (5) reliable enforcement, (6) penalties that are true disincentives, and (7) some flexibility in the system for fishermen to have alternatives to manage their bycatch. The Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery, with an estimated 20,000 licensed boats, is currently too large for individual bycatch quotas to be practical, although individual or cooperative bycatch quotas would be excellent strategies for reducing the bycatch of a smaller fleet. Mobile closed areas might be beneficial for reducing the bycatch of particular species, but these short-term closures would require real-time monitoring of bycatch rates and vessel monitoring systems on all vessels. However, under any management regime, incentives and/or rigorously enforced disincentives are the key to successful bycatch reduction.},

This view, as reflected in U.S. and worldwide legislation and agreements, demonstrates the widely held belief that discarded portions of fishery catches (including economic resources, protected species, and unobserved mortalities of animals not caught) represent an unacceptable waste of natural resources. Bycatches in their various forms can have significant consequences for populations, food webs, and ecosystems. The economic effects of bycatches can influence not only the levels of yields to individual fisheries, but also may have major effects on allocations among competing fisheries. The lack of comprehensive monitoring programs in most areas to assess bycatches and integrate them into population and multispecies models seriously impedes a full understanding of bycatch consequences and the efficacy of measures for their amelioration. Nevertheless, where evidence for significant bycatches exists, a risk-averse and perhaps adaptive management philosophy is clearly warranted. Establishing the benefits and costs associated with bycatch management is a priority as managers attempt to define the practicality of bycatches approaching zero given the institutional, scientific, and industry resources necessary to accomplish the job.},

Catch rates were compared between a seasonal closure, a permanent closure, and adjacent waters open to mobile gear fishing. Winter flounder Pleuronecles americanus and scup Stenotomus chrysops were more abundant in the two protected areas. Black sea bass Centropristis striata and windowpane Scophthalmus aquosus were more abundant in the seasonal closure but not in the permanent closure. Abundance indices of summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and longfin squid were not significantly different between the seasonal closure and the exploited area but both species were less abundant in the permanent closure. Little skate Raja erinacea were more abundant in areas open to trawling. Significantly lower catch rates of the latter four species in the permanent closure indicated that habitat differences were important in determining local abundance. Decreased local density of finfish in open areas was not related to inshore spring squid trawling effort or landings. Regional trawl effort on Georges Bank and in southern New England did have significantly negative effects on local finfish density. Inferences of causal relationships between the inshore squid fishery and decreased local abundance of finfish were not supported. These results suggest that inshore abundance of these species is more related to total regional trawl effort.},

	abstract = {Bycatch of Yellowtail Flounder in the U.S. Sea Scallop Fishery is a constraint to achieving optimum yield of scallops. Between 2000 and 2009, in-season bycatch closures of prime scallop grounds resulted in economic losses over US\$100 million. To address this constraint, we collaborated with the scallop fishing industry to implement a bycatch avoidance program in the Nantucket Lightship harvest area in 2010. Vessels shared near real-time location information about bycatch amounts during fishing activities. We compiled the information, identified bycatch hotspots, and provided daily advisories to vessels on the fishing grounds. Catch per tow of Yellowtail and fishing effort in high bycatch regions significantly declined after the fleet received the advisories. The fleet harvested the target scallop allocation worth US\$40 million while catching only 32\% of the Yellowtail bycatch limit. This program continues as a collaborative, iterative approach to bycatch reduction that balances fleet objectives with conservation constraints.},

Bird numbers increased rapidly after dawn and large numbers of Cape, giant and storm petrels and smaller numbers of white-chinned petrels and black-browed albatrosses were present during day hauling operations. No incidental mortality was seen and only one bird was caught on a hook; nevertheless many species in these aggregations of birds are clearly potentially vulnerable to setting operations in daylight hours. Several species of the seabirds present presumably originated from South Georgia populations; however wandering and grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations are in serious decline at South Georgia, were rare; their vulnerability to longlining operations in the South Sandwich Islands may, therefore, be low. Quantitative data and observations of longline vessels fishing around South Georgia, however, indicate significant catch rates of albatrosses.},

We use a bio-economic approach to demonstrate that compensatory mitigation – an innovative, market-influenced approach to fishery–conservation conflicts – can facilitate high-value uses of biological resources and cost-effective conservation gains for species of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more effective from a return-on-investment perspective (ie percent increase in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries closures, and is more socio-politically feasible. A bycatch levy, which would increase with endangerment, provides an individual incentive for avoiding bycatch, the most effective mechanism for sustainable management of fisheries. Compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity to address a global concern, optimize conservation interventions, and forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations.},

	abstract = {This review summarises current understanding of what scallops are feeding upon and how they acquire energy through feeding activity and expend energy through their metabolic processes. While the principles of feeding activity are consistent across many species, there are major differences in the efficiency and retention of food particles related to variations in the characteristics of the gill type. Differences in life histories and the wide variety of habitats exploited by scallops are reflected in substantial differences in the rate of clearance of particles, particularly as it relates to the concentration of food. Many of the differences observed in feeding activity within and between scallop species over the years and the lack of consistent trends and patterns of feeding behaviour could be attributed to differences in techniques used. One major factor could be the reliance in the earlier studies on cultured microalgae as a homogeneous food supply and the focus in more recent studies on natural assemblages of particles as experimental food sources. We have come to recognise that scallops behave differently than other species of bivalves such as mussels even when they are studied simultaneously using the identical food supply. Like other species of bivalves, scallops produce pseudofeces as a mechanism to alter food composition before ingestion and the efficiency of this selection process has been shown to vary between species and environmental conditions. There have been no consistent relationships between absorption efficiency and any characteristics of the food supply in the scallop species studied to date. Current velocity can have a neutral or positive influence on feeding and growth at low or moderate velocities, but both feeding and growth are reduced at the higher velocities tested. Harmful and toxic algae produce a variety of negative effects on scallops dependent upon the algal species and their concentration, the pectinid species and its life stage, just to mention a few. Reductions in clearance rate have been cited for some species and will have a significant impact on the acquisition of energy to support maintenance, growth and reproduction. The measurement of oxygen consumption as an indicator of metabolic energy expenditure in scallops is known to vary with body size, physiological condition and most environmental conditions assessed. The availability of ambient oxygen, seasonal activity related to reproductive condition and/or temperature and activity level associated with swimming are all known to influence oxygen consumption and have significant impacts on energy expenditure (see Chapter 12 by Guderley and Tremblay for more detail on the physiological and biochemical responses of scallop swimming behaviour). Nitrogenous excretion may represent a significant loss of energy for some pectinids under certain stressful conditions however byssus production is thought to only represent a minor component of the energy budget. The amount of energy available to support growth varies with size and age as the investment in energy for reproduction usually increases with age in the longer lived species of pectinids. Pectinids exhibit a wide range of growth rates related to differences in life histories and longevity often associated with distribution patterns, latitude and water depth that influence their environmental conditions such as temperature and food supply.},

output from a high resolution numerical ocean model simulation of the

this phenomenon. It is found that the model shows skill in simulating
the anomaly fields derived from various sources of data, and the
observed warming trend over the last decade. From analysis of the model
run it is found that the anomalies originate from the interaction
between the Gulf Stream and the Labrador Current at the tail of the
Grand Banks (south of Newfoundland). This interaction results in the
creation of anomalous warm/salty (or cold/fresh) eddies that travel
east-to-west along the shelfbreak. These anomalies penetrate into the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, onto the Scotian Shelf, and into the Gulf of Maine
via deep channels along the shelfbreak. The observed warming trend can
be attributed to an increase in the frequency of creation of warm
anomalies during the last decade. Strong anomalous events are commonly
observed in the data and model, and thus should be considered as part of
the natural variability of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system.},

	title = {How much observer coverage is enough to adequately estimate bycatch},
	abstract = {Bycatch is a critical source of mortality for marine species, including endangered species, heavily fished commercial and recreational target species, and many species of so-called “trash fish ” whose importance in marine food webs is now being recognized. Whether management objectives include conservation or fisheries yields, adequate measurement of at-sea mortality is a necessary component of any management framework, and observers at sea are the most reliable source of information. The amount of observer effort, when not financially constrained, is usually set to achieve a desirable level of precision, assuming that the observers sample the fleet randomly. The assumption of random sampling is often unjustified, as the sampling process is both conceptually and operationally very complex. The issue of bias in bycatch estimates is often not addressed, despite the fact that many observer programs allocate sampling effort opportunistically to vessels that volunteer to carry observers. The bias introduced by nonrandom sampling, and by the changes in fishermen’s behavior in the presence of observers, must be addressed. Comparing the catches of observed and unobserved vessel-trips should be an ongoing component of any observer program. If the observer samples are an unbiased sample of the fishery, our literature review and simulation studies suggest that coverage levels of at least 20 percent for common species, and 50 percent for rare species, would give reasonably good estimates of total bycatch. The required level of coverage, however, could be much higher or much lower for a particular fishery, depending on the size of the fishery, distribution of catch and bycatch, and spatial stratification of the fishery.},

In this report, bycatch is defined as the observed discarded catch, summed over from eleven different groundfish species. Estimates of unobserved discards are not considered. All retained catches are included whether or not the catches were incidental to the target species. Emphasis is placed on the methods used to define the sampling frame (i.e., the population of commercial fishing trips to be sampled), appropriate stratification, and efficient allocation of sampling effort to these strata. Efficient allocation of sampling effort within a stratified survey design improves the precision of the estimate of overall discard rates. Accuracy of sample estimates is evaluated by comparing various performance measures (e.g., landings, trip duration) between vessels with and without observers present. Although formal statistical distinctions between accuracy and bias of estimators and estimates can be made, in this report we use the terms interchangeably and less formally.

To characterize trends in the bycatch of three flatfish species, a fishery-independent scallop dredge survey was conducted in two sea scallop access areas (Closed Areas I and II) on Georges Bank from 2011 to 2014. Generalized additive mixed models were used to identify seasonal bycatch hotspots of yellowtail, winter, and windowpane flounder. In all cases, spatially explicit models best fit the data (deviance explained: 47–73\%) and provided insight into the spatial distribution underlying the seasonal trends in each area. Modeled catch rates for the three flatfish species suggested localized catches at discrete times of the year. Catches of yellowtail and windowpane flounder were highest in Closed Area II in the fall and winter, respectively. Winter flounder were caught in the highest numbers in Closed Area I during the summer and fall, and were largely absent from catches in Closed Area II. Our results suggest consistent seasonal trends that may help managers identify the optimal times to open the access areas to the scallop fleet in order to reduce flatfish bycatch.},

The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines.

Model averaging and ensemble methods were used to combine the results of converged models for each species. Model averaging was based on both predictive (i.e., cross-validation, AIC) and retrospective performance metrics. Models allowing large shifts in M provided the best fit to observed data for both species and were also regarded as the most plausible. For Atlantic Cod, variance in biomass estimates among the individual models was very high and multimodel estimates were sensitive to the relative weight given to competing models. In contrast, converged Yellowtail Flounder models produced broadly similar output and multimodel estimates were more robust to model weights.

	abstract = {Spatial erosion of stock structure through local overfishing can lead to stock collapse because fish often prefer certain locations, and fisheries tend to focus on those locations. Fishery managers are challenged to maintain the integrity of the entire stock and require scientific approaches that provide them with sound advice. Here we propose a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling framework for fish abundance data to estimate key parameters that define spatial stock structure: persistence (similarity of spatial structure over time), connectivity (coherence of temporal pattern over space), and spatial variance (variation across the seascape). The consideration of these spatial parameters in the stock assessment process can help identify the erosion of structure and assist in preventing local overfishing. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in eastern Canada as a case study an examine the behaviour of these parameters from the height of the fishery through its collapse. We identify clear signals in parameter behaviour under circumstances of destructive stock erosion as well as for recovery of spatial structure even when combined with a non-recovery in abundance. Further, our model reveals the spatial pattern of areas of high and low density persists over the 41 years of available data and identifies the remnant patches. Models of this sort are crucial to recovery plans if we are to identify and protect remaining sources of recolonization for Atlantic cod. Our method is immediately applicable to other exploited species.},

This study considers the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, a region of high social and ecological importance in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and synthesizes current knowledge of (a) key seasonal processes, patterns, and events; (b) direct evidence for shifts in timing; (c) implications of phenological responses for linked ecological-human systems; and (d) potential phenology-focused adaptation strategies and actions. Twenty studies demonstrated shifts in timing of regional marine organisms and seasonal environmental events. The most common response was earlier timing, observed in spring onset, spring and winter hydrology, zooplankton abundance, occurrence of several larval fishes, and diadromous fish migrations. Later timing was documented for fall onset, reproduction and fledging in Atlantic puffins, spring and fall phytoplankton blooms, and occurrence of additional larval fishes. Changes in event duration generally increased and were detected in zooplankton peak abundance, early life history periods of macro-invertebrates, and lobster fishery landings. Reduced duration was observed in winter–spring ice-affected stream flows. Two studies projected phenological changes, both finding diapause duration would decrease in zooplankton under future climate scenarios. Phenological responses were species-specific and varied depending on the environmental driver, spatial, and temporal scales evaluated. Overall, a wide range of baseline phenology and relevant modeling studies exist, yet surprisingly few document long-term shifts. Results reveal a need for increased emphasis on phenological shifts in the Gulf of Maine and identify opportunities for future research and consideration of phenological changes in adaptation efforts.},

	abstract = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the “6-S” selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a “balanced exploitation” approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},

A range of policies are explored to find those that produce “Pretty Good Yield” defined as sustainable yield at least 80\% of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20–50\% of unfished stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population's basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted definitions of overfishing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50\% of unfished stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield.},

The number of overfished populations, as well as the indirect effects of fisheries on marine ecosystems, indicate that management has failed to achieve a principal goal, sustainability. This failure is primarily due to continually increasing harvest rates in response to incessant sociopolitical pressure for greater harvests and the intrinsic uncertainty in predicting the harvest that will cause population collapse. A more holistic approach incorporating interspecific interactions and physical environmental influences would contribute to greater sustainability by reducing the uncertainty in predictions. However, transforming the management process to reduce the influence of pressure for greater harvest holds more immediate promise.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a personal perspective on the future of ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). I begin with the question, “if we did single species management well, would EBFM be necessary.” The answer to this is yes, because pure single-species management does not consider impacts on non-target species, trophic interactions among species, and habitat-destroying fishing practices. Pure single-species management conflicts with a range of legislation designed to protect non-target species and habitats within the U.S. and a number of other countries. The most important elements of EBFM are keeping fishing mortality rates low enough to prevent ecosystem-wide overfishing, reducing or eliminating by-catch and avoiding habitat-destroying fishing methods. There is a second phase of EBFM I call “extended EBFM” that consists of considering trophic interactions and area-based management. While there are now models of the trophic interactions for most highly managed ecosystems, and there are area-based management efforts underway in many places, I am not convinced that we are really ready, scientifically and administratively, to apply these forms of EBFM, because they are expensive and require complex trade-offs that are often ill-defined.},

	abstract = {Some fishery characteristics such as total discards are often inferred from data collected by at-sea observers on a subset of fishing trips. Such inference is predicated on the assumption that observed and unobserved trips are statistically exchangeable. There are two principal reasons why this may not be so. A deployment effect results from nonrandom distribution of observers among sampling units. An observer effect results from changes in fishing practice or location when observers are present. Both effects can impact the precision and accuracy of fishery-level inferences drawn from observer data, though this is rarely addressed quantitatively. We found evidence for deployment and observer effects in Gulf of St. Lawrence fisheries. The impact of deployment bias was further quantified by resampling from fisheries data collected with 100\% observer coverage. We conclude that the nature of the effects observed in our study preclude merely correcting observer-collected catch data for possible biases and imprecision. Furthermore, regulatory compliance monitoring by observers in the existing program may not be completely effective. Modifications to program structure would therefore be beneficial and some suggestions are evaluated in this paper.},

We present a cost-efficient strategy to help enforce regulations against discarding. A discarding indicator is defined using the change in slope between two reference points on the empirical length-frequency density of the catch. This discarding indicator is then used according to the external distribution concept: the sampling distribution of the discarding indicator, when no discarding occurred, is obtained directly from samples taken by onboard observers; the value of the discarding indicator observed by onshore observers from a boat not covered by onboard observers is then compared with this sampling distribution. This procedure offers a nonparametric test for discarding. Application of the strategy is illustrated using data from the 1991 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fishery in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We describe several enforcement frameworks within which the method can be applied. The cost efficiency of the strategy comes from shifting resources from high-cost onboard observation to lower cost onshore observation.},

Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although they are the ones whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation of cod stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased discarding of juvenile cod. Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective landings control system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery.},

We describe case studies of fleet communication programs of the US North Atlantic longline swordfish fishery, US North Pacific and Alaska trawl fisheries, and US Alaska demersal longline fisheries, and identify alternative fleet communication program designs to reduce fisheries bycatch. Evidence supports the inference that these three fleet communication programs substantially reduced fisheries bycatch and provided economic benefits that greatly outweighed operational costs. Fleet communication may be appropriate in fisheries where there are strong economic incentives to reduce bycatch, interactions with bycatch species are rare events, adequate onboard observer coverage exists, and for large fleets, vessels are represented by a fishery association.},

	abstract = {Time/area closures have been widely used in fisheries management to prevent overfishing and the destruction of marine biodiversity. To a lesser degree, such spatio-temporal management measures have been used to reduce by-catch of finfish or protected species. However, as ecosystem-based management approaches are employed and more fisheries are managed through multispecies, multiobjective models, the management of by-catch will likely become increasingly important. The elimination of by-catch has become a primary goal of the fishing policies of many countries. It is particularly relevant in the United States, as the deadline for setting annual catch limits (ACLs) in all fisheries passes in 2011. This will result in a dramatic expansion of the number of catch and by-catch quotas. Such catch measures may result in the early closure of otherwise sustainable fisheries when by-catch quotas are exceeded. To prevent such closures and the consequent economic hardship to fishers and the economy, it is imperative that managers be given the tools necessary to reduce by-catch and improve fishing selectivity. Targeted spatio-temporal fishery closures are one solution open to managers. Here, we examine how the spatio-temporal and oceanographic characteristics of by-catch may be used by managers to design fishery closures, and place these methods within a decision tree to assist managers to identify appropriate management measures. We argue that the current movement towards marine spatial planning (MSP) presents an important impetus to examine how we manage fisheries spatially, and we offer a first step towards the objective participation of fisheries in the MSP process.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) longline fishery is the second most valuable groundfish fishery in Atlantic Canada and received Marine Stewardship Council certification in 2013. The bottom longline fishery accounts for most halibut landings but incidentally catches nontargeted species (bycatch). Since 1998, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the halibut fishing industry performed annual longline surveys across the Scotian Shelf and Southern Grand Banks stock management area to monitor halibut abundance, and at-sea observers also recorded bycatch information. We examined the species composition and proportion of the survey bycatch and analyzed temporal and spatial trends in standardized weight of (a) halibut catch, (b) total bycatch, and (c) bycatch of species of conservation concern. From 1998 to 2016, 70\% of the total catch by weight and 85\% by number of individuals were bycatch. Over 100 identified species of finfish, sharks, skates, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals, and seabirds were caught as bycatch in the survey. This included four species listed under the Species at Risk Act (Northern wolffish, Anarhichas denticulatus; spotted wolffish, A. minor; Atlantic wolffish, A. lupus; Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua), and another 14 species awaiting a listing decision based on assessments by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Generally, the standardized weight of halibut and barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis) increased over time, while Atlantic cod, spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) decreased. Spatial patterns indicated high bycatch levels on the southern Scotian Shelf and southern edge of the Southern Grand Banks, with hotspots for certain species of conservation concern. Our results identify temporal trends in threatened species and areas where they are susceptible to the Atlantic halibut longline fishery which can inform recovery strategies, bycatch levels and spatial zoning in fisheries management and marine conservation.},

The present review aims to describe the current state-of-the-art in discards research, with particular emphasis on the needs and challenges associated with the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in European waters. We briefly review the international and European policy contexts of discarding, how discard data are collected and incorporated into stock assessments, selectivity in fishing and the main consequences of discarding for ecosystem dynamics. We then review implementation issues related to reducing discards under the EAFM and the associated scientific challenges, and conclude with some comments on lessons learned and future directions.},

	abstract = {Bycatch in fisheries can have profound effects on the abundance of species with relatively low resilience to increased mortality, can alter the evolutionary characteristics and concomitant fitness of affected populations through heritable trait-based selective removals, and can alter ecosystem functions, structure and services through food web trophic links. We challenge current piecemeal bycatch management paradigms, which reduce the mortality of one taxon of conservation concern at the unintended expense of others. Bycatch mitigation measures may also reduce intraspecific genetic diversity. We drew examples of broadly prescribed ‘best practice’ methods to mitigate bycatch that result in unintended cross-taxa conflicts from pelagic longline, tuna purse seine, gillnet and trawl fisheries. We identified priority improvements in data quality and in understanding ecological effects of bycatch fishing mortality to support holistic ecological risk assessments of the effects of bycatch removals conducted through semi-quantitative and model-based approaches. A transition to integrated bycatch assessment and management that comprehensively consider biodiversity across its hierarchical manifestations is needed, where relative risks and conflicts from alternative bycatch management measures are evaluated and accounted for in fisheries decision-making processes. This would enable managers to select measures with intentional and acceptable tradeoffs to best meet objectives, when conflicts are unavoidable.},

	abstract = {The catch of non-target species or discarding of target species (bycatch) in commercial fisheries can result in negative species level and ecosystem wide impacts as well as adverse social and economic effects. Bycatch has become one of the foremost, global issues of fishery managers and conservationists, especially when the non-target species is from a protected or threatened population. However, the impact and spatial distribution of bycatch is frequently unknown making it difficult to develop effective, justifiable mitigation regulations. This challenge is exemplified by the bycatch of river herring (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, A. aestivalis) and American shad (A. sapidissima) in the northwest Atlantic mid-water trawl fishery targeting Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). As an alternative to immediate management action, a voluntary bycatch avoidance program was established through an industry, state government, and university partnership. Here the program is described and its impact is evaluated by comparing fleet behavior and bycatch prior to and during the program. The combined results suggest that consistent communication, facilitated by the avoidance program, positively influenced fishing habits and played a role in the approximately 60\% decrease in total bycatch and 20\% decrease in the bycatch ratio observed during the program. However, the success of small scale move-along strategies to reduce bycatch ratios varied greatly in different areas of the fishery and years. This suggests the program is best viewed as an intermediate or complimentary solution. Overall, this project exemplifies of how collaborative programs can help alleviate difficult management scenarios.},

Electronic monitoring may become the most effective method to monitor discards, as it has the capacity to overcome most sources of statistical sampling bias of conventional human onboard observer programs. Other monitoring approaches, including logbooks, fishery-independent surveys and fisher interviews, produce relatively unreliable discard estimates, while port sampling only provides information on landed catch. Modifications to fishing practices and gear to increase selectivity are main approaches used to reduce discards. Managing the temporal and spatial distribution of fishing effort by employing tools such as dynamic spatial management and fleet communication are additional discards management tools. Landing obligations, retention bans, bycatch caps, effort limits and size restrictions are additional approaches for which strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Continual evaluation is necessary to understand ever-changing causes of fishers' discarding decisions so that important factors can be accounted for in designing monitoring programs and discard models, and guide the adaptation of measures to manage and reduce discards.},

However, permanent fishing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial management tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a comanagement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and regulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spatial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch.

Fisheries managers shifting from a target species focus to an ecosystem-based approach are being required to consider the impact of fisheries on non-target species. There are a range of complementary management tools that help reduce bycatch, such as gear restrictions, temporal restrictions, and bycatch reduction devices. One management approach that is increasingly being considered is fisheries closures. We tested the utility of 3 closure approaches for the improved protection of bycatch species in the South African pelagic longline fishery. As there was some variation where and when different groups of bycatch species were caught, we found that temporary spatial closures were the most effective strategy for both protecting bycatch and minimizing the cost to fishers. This is logical because having mobile closures in space and time provides more flexibility than permanent spatial closures or seasonal closures. However these benefits need to be traded off against the costs and problems of implementing temporary spatial closures. Of the 2 sub-optimal strategies, we discovered that seasonal closures are significantly less effective than spatial closures.},

	abstract = {Food security and the economic well-being of millions of people depend on sustainable fisheries, which require innovative approaches to management that can balance ecological, economic, and social objectives. We offer empirical evidence that dynamic ocean management, or real-time ocean management, can increase the efficacy and efficiency of fisheries management over static approaches by better aligning human and ecological scales of use. Furthermore, we show that dynamic management can address critical ecological patterns previously considered to be largely intractable in fisheries management (e.g., competition, niche partitioning, predation, parasitism, or social aggregations) at appropriate scales. The evidence and theory offered supports the use of dynamic ocean management in a range of scenarios to improve the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of fisheries., In response to the inherent dynamic nature of the oceans and continuing difficulty in managing ecosystem impacts of fisheries, interest in the concept of dynamic ocean management, or real-time management of ocean resources, has accelerated in the last several years. However, scientists have yet to quantitatively assess the efficiency of dynamic management over static management. Of particular interest is how scale influences effectiveness, both in terms of how it reflects underlying ecological processes and how this relates to potential efficiency gains. Here, we address the empirical evidence gap and further the ecological theory underpinning dynamic management. We illustrate, through the simulation of closures across a range of spatiotemporal scales, that dynamic ocean management can address previously intractable problems at scales associated with coactive and social patterns (e.g., competition, predation, niche partitioning, parasitism, and social aggregations). Furthermore, it can significantly improve the efficiency of management: as the resolution of the closures used increases (i.e., as the closures become more targeted), the percentage of target catch forgone or displaced decreases, the reduction ratio (bycatch/catch) increases, and the total time–area required to achieve the desired bycatch reduction decreases. In the scenario examined, coarser scale management measures (annual time–area closures and monthly full-fishery closures) would displace up to four to five times the target catch and require 100–200 times more square kilometer-days of closure than dynamic measures (grid-based closures and move-on rules). To achieve similar reductions in juvenile bycatch, the fishery would forgo or displace between USD 15–52 million in landings using a static approach over a dynamic management approach.},

Here we establish integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) as two powerful tools for modelling patterns of bycatch through time and space. These novel, computationally fast approaches are applied to ﬁt zero-inﬂated hierarchical spatiotemporal models to Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) bycatch data from the Bafﬁn Bay Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) gillnet ﬁshery. Results indicate that Greenland shark bycatch is clustered in space and time, varies signiﬁcantly from year to year, and there are both tractable factors (number of gillnet panels, total Greenland halibut catch) and physical features (bathymetry) leading to the high incidence of Greenland shark bycatch. Bycatch risk could be reduced by limiting access to spatiotemporal hotspots or by establishing a maximum number of panels per haul. Our method explicitly models the spatiotemporal correlation structure inherent in bycatch data at a very reasonable computational cost, such that the forecasting of bycatch patterns and simulating conservation strategies becomes more accessible.},

While large-scale estimates are needed to understand cumulative impacts on these highly migratory species, detailed information on targeting, setting, and discarding practices is needed to develop bycatch mitigation approaches. Data from qualitative ﬁshers’ knowledge interviews with Canadian Atlantic pelagic longline captains was used to evaluate current bycatch estimation methods and to identify bycatch mitigation opportunities. Interviewed longline captains reported blue sharks (Prionace glauca) were common bycatch during swordﬁsh-targeted sets, but were sometimes absent from tuna-targeted sets. Discrepancies between longline captains’ observations and bycatch assessment methods identiﬁed needed improvements to data collection methods. Longline captains reported innovative uses of turtle dehooking gear, which two-thirds of interviewed captains had used to release other bycatch species in addition to turtles. Longline captains reported techniques for discarding pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), a common bycatch species in Paciﬁc, Atlantic and Mediterranean pelagic longline ﬁsheries. Therefore, such techniques could decrease ﬁsheries impacts globally. While there can be major conservation beneﬁts from ﬁshers’ knowledge research, one-quarter of the active longline captains that we contacted declined interviews because they did not trust the larger research process. We urge conservation biologists to carefully design ﬁshers’ knowledge research taking into account the often politicized context. Failure to do so may jeopardize future research and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Atlantic cod form spawning aggregations in locations and seasons that are persistent from year to year and individual ﬁsh have been shown to exhibit spawning site ﬁdelity and home to speciﬁc spawning grounds each season. In the Gulf of Maine, cod are known to have historically occupied a mosaic of spawning grounds but many of these spawning components have been extirpated, primarily through overﬁshing, with a near complete loss of spawning along mid-coast and eastern Maine. The remaining spawning aggregations in the western Gulf of Maine are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation owing to their proximity to shore, the predictability of their timing, the ﬁne-scales upon which they operate, and the high density of ﬁsh within each aggregation. Broad scale management actions that are currently being discussed may allow an increased harvest from these spawning aggregations. In this paper we describe the creation of three small-scale area closures that serve to eliminate the exploitation and disturbance of discrete spawning aggregations of Atlantic cod and prevent the potential extirpation of these spawning components. Each closure was unique in the circumstances that surrounded their creation, including differences in the amount of prior protection from commercial and recreational exploitation, the timing and duration of the closure, the size of the closure area, the management body that had authority to enact the closure, the amount of monitoring that has occurred, and the amount of spatial or temporal modiﬁcations that have occurred since enactment. We believe the case for spawning closures for Atlantic cod has already been made by several authors and the purpose of this paper is not to present new science, but rather to show the path that was followed to create these spawning closures within the complicated array of ﬁsheries management.},

	abstract = {River herring, which comprise two species of anadromous alosines (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, Alosa aestivalis), are under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. River herring populations have not rebounded despite reductions in directed ﬁshing on these species and improvements in their freshwater and estuarine habitats. We examined recent (2005–2009) spatial and temporal patterns of ﬁshing effort in the US ﬁshery for Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, and river herring bycatch patterns in this ﬁshery. During the year, Atlantic herring ﬁshing activity shifts spatially and temporally from the Northern Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England waters in January–February, to Southern New England waters in March–April, to the Gulf of Maine in May–June, expanding to the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank in July–August and September–October, respectively, and then contracting to the Gulf of Maine and Southern New England waters in November–December. At-sea ﬁsheries observer data indicate that river herring bycatches in the Atlantic herring ﬁshery occur mostly during January–April and September–December, primarily in Southern New England and the Northern MidAtlantic Bight waters. We discuss possible management measure to reduce these bycatches. Similar size, shape, and schooling behaviors between river herring and other pelagic species—and the high volume nature of the Atlantic herring ﬁshery—limit the potential efﬁcacy of gear-based bycatch mitigation measures. Hence, approaches such as regulatory management measures (e.g., time–area closures and catch caps) and improved ﬂeet communication strategies (e.g., “move-on” rules) may be more practical and effective in minimizing river herring bycatch in the Atlantic herring ﬁshery.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. However, their performance is known to be affected by a variety of factors related to species occurrence characteristics. In this study, we used a virtual species approach to overcome the difficulties associated with testing of combined effects of those factors on performance of presence-only SDMs when using real data. We focused on the individual and combined roles of factors related to response variable (i.e. sample size, sampling bias, environmental filtering, species prevalence, and species response to environmental gradients). Results suggest that environmental filtering is not necessarily helpful and should not be performed blindly, without evidence of bias in species occurrences. The more gradual the species response to environmental gradients is, the greater is the model sensitivity to an inappropriate use of environmental filtering, although this sensitivity decreases with higher species prevalence. Results show that SDMs are affected to the greatest degree by the species response to environmental gradients, species prevalence, and sample size. Models’ accuracy decreased with sample size below 300 presences. Furthermore, a high level of interactions among individual factors was observed. Ignoring the combined effects of factors may lead to misleading outcomes and conclusions.},

Here we focus on how these key factors interact to influence the results seen once reserves are created. For a settlement-limited fishery, export of increased production from within reserves can offset the effects of displaced fishing effort. We develop simple mathematical models that indicate net fisheries benefits can accrue at closures up to and perhaps beyond 50\% of total stock area through the export of production, given documented average increases in biomass within reserves. However, reserve monitoring programs face problems identifying independent control sites because the spatial extent of export is unknown. Efforts to monitor reserve impacts on recruitment are further complicated by the fact that large reserve closures are likely necessary before significant changes in recruitment can be detected above normal interannual fluctuations. Resolving these limitations requires comprehensive monitoring data before reserves are implemented. Fortunately, studies of reserves that used Before–After, Control– Impact (BACI) experimental designs show that control and reserve sites were equivalent prior to protection, and that control sites improved after reserves were in place. Consequently, any bias in our current perception of reserve impacts likely underestimates their effect.},

	abstract = {Mortality of discarded Pacific halibut bycatch from Pacific cod fisheries in the Bering Sea leads to significant losses in the halibut setline and in the Pacific cod fisheries. The commercial halibut fishery loses yield because of catch limit reductions to compensate the resource for lost spawning potential and because halibut killed as bycatch will not be available for subsequent harvest, and the cod fisheries may lose harvest if they reach a bycatch mortality limit before reaching allowed catch. In this study, significant differences in Pacific halibut bycatch rates and associated yield losses were found among months and areas of the Bering Sea in the longline and trawl fisheries for Pacific cod in 1990–1992. Bycatch rates were usually highest in late spring and early summer and in areas close to the Unimak Pass. With the exception of 1992, yield loss in the longline fishery was around 1 kg per kg of bycatch mortality, irrespective of where or when bycatch occurred. In the trawl fishery, loss of halibut yield varied from 1 to 4 kg per kg of bycatch mortality. Highest halibut net yield losses per tonne of groundfish harvest usually coincided with highest bycatch rates. When both fisheries operated in one area, trawl bycatch often imposed higher yield losses than longline bycatch, despite lower bycatch rates. Bycatch was affected by the strong 1987 halibut year class. Highest bycatch and yield loss rates occurred in the trawl fishery in 1990 and 1991 when the population was dominated by halibut age-3 and -4, and in the longline fishery in 1992 as fish reached age-5.},

The bycatch-to-shrimp ratio of the shrimp fishery was 15.32, 6.78 and 13.68 in 1987/1988, 1988/1989 and 1989/1990, respectively. Total bycatch in the shrimp trawling ranged from 34740 to 55500tonnes (t) during the study period, and more than 98\% of the bycatch was discarded at sea. The total discards from the shrimp fishery was 7.5-fold higher than the mean of annual finfish landings in Kuwait. The major part of the discarded was non-Ariid finfish, accounting to 53.61\%.},

	abstract = {Managing diverse ecosystems is challenging because structuring drivers are often processes having diffuse impacts that attenuate from the people who were “managed” to the expected ecosystem-wide outcome. Coral reef fishes targeted for management only indirectly link to the ecosystem’s foundation (reef corals). Three successively weakening interaction tiers separate management of fishing from coral abundance. We studied 12 islands along the 700-km eastern Caribbean archipelago, comparing fished and unfished coral reefs. Fishing reduced biomass of carnivorous (snappers and groupers) and herbivorous (parrotfish and surgeonfish) fishes. We document attenuating but important effects of managing fishing, which explained 37\% of variance in parrotfish abundance, 20\% of variance in harmful algal abundance, and 17\% of variance in juvenile coral abundance. The explained variance increased when we quantified herbivory using area-specific bite rates. Local fisheries management resulted in a 62\% increase in the archipelago’s juvenile coral density, improving the ecosystem’s recovery potential from major disturbances.
Local management improves coral reef’s capacity to recover from disturbances, but the signal attenuates unless properly measured.

However, analysis of such data often ignores the inherent spatial and temporal grouping of the observations, and hence, the data hierarchy. This paper proposes the use of linear mixed-effects models as an effective means of analyzing and comparing weight–length relationships and indices of condition when there are many groups. The use of simple linear regression (where grouping is ignored), ANCOVA (where group effects are incorporated as fixed-effects), and linear mixed-effects models (where group effects are random-effects) are compared using data for Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus). The group means of residuals is proposed as a measure of relative weight or index of population condition. Linear mixed-effects models should be used to analyze grouped data because the variability among groups is ignored in simple linear regression and ANCOVA. Also, it is important that explanatory variables be incorporated in analyses of grouped data because their influence may mask the true differences among groups.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a key strategy for mitigating the impacts of fisheries, but their designation can be controversial, and there is uncertainty surrounding when and where MPAs are most effective. Evidence synthesis that collates primary research on MPA effectiveness can provide a crucial bridge between research, policy and practice. However, reviews vary in scope and rigour, meaning decision-makers face the challenge of identifying appropriate reviews. Documenting differences amongst reviews can therefore support nonspecialists in locating the most relevant and rigorous reviews and can also assist researchers in targeting evidence gaps. We addressed these priorities by systematically searching for reviews examining effectiveness of MPAs for biodiversity, critically appraising methods used and categorizing review scope. The 27 reviews assessed overlapped in scope (suggesting some redundancy) and differed substantially in reliability. Key strengths related to the effects of MPAs on fish abundance and the influence of MPA size and age on effectiveness. However, several gaps were noted, with some questions not addressed and others lacking highly reliable syntheses – importantly, the latter may create the perception that particular questions have been adequately addressed, potentially deterring new syntheses. Our findings indicate key aspects of review conduct that could be improved (e.g. documenting critical appraisal of primary research, evaluating potential publication bias) and can facilitate evidence-based policy by guiding nonspecialists to the most reliable and relevant reviews. Lastly, we suggest that future reviews with broader taxonomic coverage and considering the influence of a wider range of MPA characteristics on effectiveness would be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Management of the diverse fisheries of the world has had mixed success. While managing single species in data-rich environments has been largely effective, perhaps the greatest challenge facing fishery managers is how to deal with mixed stocks of fish with a range of life histories that reside in the same location. Because many fishing gears are nonselective, and the costs of making gear selective can be high, a particular problem is bycatch of weak stocks. This problem is most severe when the weak stock is long-lived and has low fecundity and thus requires a very long recovery time once overfished. We investigate the role that marine reserves might play in solving this challenging and ubiquitous problem in ecosystem-based management. Evidence for marine reserves’ potential to manage fisheries in an ecosystem context has been mixed, so we develop a heuristic strategic mathematical model to obtain general conclusions about the merits of managing multispecies fisheries by using reserves relative to managing them with nonspatial approaches. We show that for many fisheries, yields of strong stocks can be increased, and persistence of weak stocks can be ensured, by using marine reserves rather than by using traditional nonspatial approaches alone. Thus, reserves have a distinct advantage as a management tool in many of the most critical multispecies settings. We also show how the West Coast groundfish fishery of the United States meets these conditions, suggesting that management by reserves may be a superior option in that case.},

Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71\% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity.

Designed to conserve marine biodiversity, many MPAs also seek to foster sustainable development. As is the case for many other environmental policies and programs, the impacts of MPAs are poorly understood. Social-ecological systems, impact evaluation, and common-pool resource governance are three complementary scientific frameworks for documenting and explaining the ecological and social impacts of conservation interventions. We review key components of these three frameworks and their implications for the study of conservation policy, program, and project outcomes. Using MPAs as an illustrative example, we then draw upon these three frameworks to describe an integrated approach for rigorous empirical documentation and causal explanation of conservation impacts. This integrated three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in social-ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations, builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent complexity of social-ecological systems and the difficulty of causal inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation initiatives.},

	abstract = {Shortly after the implementation of a marine protected area (MPA) in Lyme Bay in 2008, inside which scallop dredging and bottom trawling is prohibited, a socio-economic impact assessment was initiated. This article presents the initial findings from this study. The aim was to understand the costs and benefits to fishermen and fish merchants of establishing the MPA. These were assessed using a combination of primary and secondary data. The results indicate that the impacts of the closure differ according to the gear type and the fishing location used by the fishermen. Static gear fishermen who fish inside the closed area have seen changes in terms of increased fishing effort, mostly because they have been able to increase the number of crab and whelk pots they deploy. The effects of the closure on static gear fishermen who fish outside the closed area has been reported in terms of increased conflicts with towed gear fishermen who now fish regularly in their traditional grounds. Fishermen using towed gear on the other hand have been impacted through displacement effects as they have been forced to look for other fishing grounds outside the closed area. Most fish merchants and processors initially claimed that they were heavily impacted by the closure but when they were interviewed 1 year after the closure they suggested a more stable picture. Preliminary analyses of landings data indicate that the introduction of the MPA has so far had minimal impacts on the average incomes and financial profits of fishermen and fish merchants. This conclusion, however, reflects a short-term view as the impacts of the closure of Lyme Bay are likely to be felt for a long time to come.},

	abstract = {In ecological systems, extremes can happen in time, such as population crashes, or in space, such as rapid range contractions. However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g., spatiotemporal modeling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur simultaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the last 16 yr. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.},

By quantifying the influence of environmental variability, fisheries management advice can be improved and uncertainties reduced. To this end, we developed statistical models of the response of Scotian Shelf silver hake stock metrics to variability in zooplankton community composition and phenology over the past 18 years and in the physical environment since 1985. Dominant modes of variability in these pelagic habitat indicators were characterized using principal component analysis, and the relationships of silver hake condition, abundance, and recruitment to pelagic habitat variability were assessed using generalized additive models. Condition was largely modulated by the onset and duration of the spring bloom, which controls food availability. In contrast, adult abundance was governed by composition of the zooplankton community and bottom-water temperature, which dictates the distribution of silver hake. Finally, recruitment was affected by both thermal conditions and food availability. Our results presented here form the basis for qualitative assessment of ecosystem attributes and the influence on silver hake stock productivity.},

In the first quarter of each calendar year from 1994 to 2006, the majority of shallow longline sets and associated loggerhead turtle bycatch were above 28° N, which corresponds to the area near the North Pacific Subtropical Frontal Zone. Based on the thermal ranges of bycatch, sets and the satellite-tagged turtles, it was recommended that shallow sets should only be deployed in waters south of the 18.5°C ({\textasciitilde}65.5°F) isotherm to decrease loggerhead turtle bycatch. This recommendation formed the basis for the TurtleWatch tool, a map providing up-to-date information about the thermal habitat of loggerhead sea turtles in the Pacific Ocean north of the Hawaiin Islands. TurtleWatch was released to fishers and managers in electronic and paper formats on December 26, 2006, to assist in decision making during the first quarter of 2007. Fishery information from 2007 was later compared with data for the years 2005 to 2006 to assess the response of the fishery to TurtleWatch. The observed fleet movement during the first quarter of 2007 was to the north of the 18.5°C ({\textasciitilde}65.5°F) isotherm (i.e. in the area recommended for avoidance by the TurtleWatch product) with increased effort and lower bycatch rates. We discuss possible reasons for this decrease in turtle bycatch north of the frontal zone together with future research directions which may lead to refinement of the TurtleWatch product.},

	abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus (ABFT) is a fish of high market value which has recently become strongly overexploited, notably in the Mediterranean Sea. This area is an essential habitat for ABFT reproduction and growth. We present here an approach for deriving the daily mapping of potential ABFT feeding and spawning habitats based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chl a concentration. The feeding habitat was mainly derived from the simultaneous occurrence of oceanic fronts of temperature and chl a content while the spawning habitat was mostly inferred from the heating of surface waters. Generally, higher chl a contents were found to be preferred for the feeding habitat and a minimum SST value was found for the spawning habitat. Both habitats were defined by the presence of relevant oceanographic features and are therefore potential and functionally-linked habitats. This approach provides, for the first time, a synoptic view of the potential ABFT habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. The model performs well in areas where both satellite data and ABFT observations are available, as 80\% of presence data are in the vicinity of potential habitats. The computed monthly, seasonal and annual maps of potential feeding and spawning habitat of ABFT from 2003 to 2009 are in good agreement with current knowledge on ABFT. Overall, the habitat size of ABFT is about 6\% of the Mediterranean Sea surface. The results displayed a strong seasonality in habitat size and locations as well as high year-to-year variations (30 to 60\%), particularly for the potential spawning habitat, which is key information for evaluating the utility of ABFT Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean Sea.},

About 80 per cent of observations in 50–100 m depth zone and 68 per cent of observations in 30–50 m depth zone were found positive.

	abstract = {Remote sensing data is useful for selection of aquaculture sites because it can provide water-quality products mapped over large regions at low cost to users. However, the spatial resolution of most ocean color satellites is too coarse to provide usable data within many estuaries. The Landsat 8 satellite, launched February 11, 2013, has both the spatial resolution and the necessary signal to noise ratio to provide temperature, as well as ocean color derived products along complex coastlines. The state of Maine (USA) has an abundance of estuarine indentations ({\textasciitilde}3,500 miles of tidal shoreline within 220 miles of coast), and an expanding aquaculture industry, which makes it a prime case-study for using Landsat 8 data to provide products suitable for aquaculture site selection. We collected the Landsat 8 scenes over coastal Maine, flagged clouds, atmospherically corrected the top-of-the-atmosphere radiances, and derived time varying fields (repeat time of Landsat 8 is 16 days) of temperature (100 m resolution), turbidity (30 m resolution), and chlorophyll a (30 m resolution). We validated the remote-sensing-based products at several in situ locations along the Maine coast where monitoring buoys and programs are in place. Initial analysis of the validated fields revealed promising new areas for oyster aquaculture. The approach used is applicable to other coastal regions and the data collected to date show potential for other applications in marine coastal environments, including water quality monitoring and ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {Ocean colour is the only essential climate variable that targets a biological variable (chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a)) and is also amenable to remote sensing at the global scale. However, the finite lifetime of individual ocean-colour sensors, and the differences in their characteristics increase the difficulty of creating a long-term, consistent, ocean-colour time series that meets the requirements of climate studies. The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), a European Space Agency programme, has recently produced a time series of satellite-based ocean-colour products at the global scale, merging data from three sensors: Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Aqua Earth Observing System (MODIS-Aqua), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), while attempting to reduce inter-sensor biases.In this work we present a comparison between the OC-CCI chlorophyll-a product and precursor satellite-derived data sets, from both single missions (SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and MERIS) and multi-mission products (global ocean colour (GlobColour) and Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs)). To this end, OC-CCI global monthly composites are compared to the similar products offered by single-mission and multi-mission records. Our results indicate that the OC-CCI product provides a higher number of observations. Comparing the observations that match with precursors, the OC-CCI product was generally most similar to the single-mission products. Relationships between OC-CCI and other precursors did not change significantly during a common and continuous period, and, on average the root-mean-square differences between log-transformed chlorophyll-a concentration are below or equal to 0.11. Further, when considering variability that could arise when merging data from different sources, it is shown that the OC-CCI product is a longer term constant than those from other multi-mission initiatives studied here.},

Despite negligible levels of fishing mortality and strong rates of production of small juvenile fish, these populations have shown no sign of recovery and some continue to decline. Lack of recovery is due to dramatic increases in the natural mortality of larger individuals in these populations. In some of these fishes, natural mortality has risen to levels typical of high-turnover forage fishes rather than long-lived demersal fishes. We hypothesize that these high levels of mortality reflect a ‘predator pit’ or predation-driven Allee effect, resulting from the severely depleted abundance of these fishes and the high and rising abundance of their marine mammal predators, in particular grey seals. Recovery of collapsed demersal fish populations does not appear to be possible under current conditions in this ecosystem, even in the absence of fishing. Our results indicate a need for more precautionary management regimes in order to avoid population collapses that are not reversible by reducing exploitation.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the fisheries sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus—one of the most important pectinid species in the world. The sea scallop is the most important commercial bivalve in North America. Sea scallop recruitment, even in the center of its range is irregular and poses undue problems to an industry that is typically overcapitalized. Sea scallop growth rates are highly variable, depending on location. Growth rates calculated for various aggregations are reported usually in the form of the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Growth rates are negatively correlated to a combination of temperature and food availability with low temperature and low food levels producing the slowest growing scallops. Knowledge of the age structure of populations, growth rate, and longevity are essential for effective management of the fishery. The production depends on recruitment patterns and the nature of management regime selected particularly for the offshore fishing areas. The application of 3-D bottom imaging is changing fishing strategies into harvesting practices. Using the latest technology in multi-beam sonar, maps detailing seabed habitat, topography, and geology are produced for the main offshore scallop fishing areas.},

Our results appear to contradict those presented by Eckman et al. (1989) for bay scallops. We point out though that their comparisons between adult and juvenile scallops involved growth experiments at different locations and in different seasons and years. Hence, differences in seston quality and concentration were likely. Recent experimental evidence presented by Wildish et al. (1991) has confirmed that seston concentration interacting with flow is a determinant of scallop feeding inhibition, and so may provide an explanation for the contradictory results. Scallops forced to orient with their exhalant facing a unidirectional current at inhibiting flows grow more slowly than controls optimally positioned with respect to flow.},

On a short temporal scale, mean CR response of both species to 0.06 μg L−1 chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 0.23 mg L−1 suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained constant despite large intra-individual fluctuations in CR. In the seasonal study, cohorts of each species were exposed to four seston treatments consisting of ambient and diluted natural seston that ranged in mean concentration from 0.15 to 0.43 mg L−1 SPM, 0.01 to 0.88 μg L−1 Chl a, 36 to 131 μg L−1 particulate organic carbon and 0.019 to 0.330 mm3 L−1 particle volume. Although food abundance in all treatments was low, the nutritional quality of the seston was relatively high (e.g., mean particulate organic content ranged from 68 to 75\%). Under these low seston conditions, a high percentage of P. maximus (81–98\%) and M. edulis (67–97\%) actively cleared particles at mean rates between 9 and 12 and between 4 and 6 L g−1 h−1, respectively. For both species, minimum mean CR values were obtained for animals exposed to the lowest seston concentrations. Within treatments, P. maximus showed a greater degree of seasonality in CR than M. edulis, which fed at a relatively constant rate despite seasonal changes in food and temperature. P. maximus showed a non-linear CR response to increasing Chl a levels, with rates increasing to a maximum at approximately 0.4 μg L−1 Chl a and then decreasing as food quantity continued to increase. Mean CR of M. edulis also peaked at a similar concentration, but remained high and stable as the food supply continued to increase and as temperatures varied between 4.6 and 19.6°C. The results show that P. maximus and M. edulis from a low seston environment, do not stop suspension-feeding at very low seston quantities; a result that contradicts previous conclusions on the suspension-feeding behavior of bivalve mollusks and which is pertinent to interpreting the biogeographic distribution of bivalve mollusks and site suitability for aquaculture.},

	abstract = {This study reports on various biological features in the life history of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) on Flemish Cap. Northern shrimp on Flemish Cap are males for approximately their first three years. Then usually half change sex at age four years, and the rest at age five years, to become females from then on. Small shrimp are generally found at lesser depth than the larger ones so the size of shrimp increases with depth, especially that of males. Larger females seem to move to shallower waters in March when hatching starts. The size at sex change (L50) and the maximum length (Lmax) are studied within and between seasons. Both L50 and Lmax have decreased in recent years. L50 was 22.5 mm CL on average in the seasons 1996/1997–2003/2004, but has decreased from 23.2 mm CL in 1997/1998 to 22.4 mm CL in 2003/2004 (Icelandic commercial data) and from 24.3 mm CL in 1994 to 20.9 mm CL in 2003 (EU survey data). Also Lmax has decreased from 29.8 mm CL in 1996/1997 to 28.0 mm CL in 2003/2004 (Icelandic commercial data). In spite of this, there is an invariant relationship between L50 and Lmax, where L50 is about 80\% of the average Lmax of northern shrimp on Flemish cap. This supports the theory of Charnov and Skúladóttir (2000) on the invariant relationship between L50 and Lmax in sex changing organisms. The same is found in Icelandic offshore waters and the Denmark Strait. The decline in L50 could be related to the observed increase in temperature at 150 m in the last decade from 2.6°C in the years 1992–1996 to 3.5°C in 1997–2003. The sudden decline in the female biomass of shrimp on Flemish Cap between 1992 and 1994 appears to coincide with a drop in the age at sex change (A50) by one year in 1995 and 1996. Moreover, the increase in biomass of shrimp follows the disappearance of cod in the mid-1990s. As female shrimp biomass increased there was a delay in changing sex, showing the versatility of shrimp on Flemish Cap in adjusting to changes in sex-ratio. Growth of shrimp was fast in the earlier years and slower in later years indicating that food may be a limiting factor. The growth during the earlier years is faster than that of northern shrimp in the Barents Sea. Compared to other areas in the 1980s, the growth is slightly faster than that of the warm inshore waters of Iceland, but much slower than the growth of shrimp in the inshore waters of Sweden. The ovigerous period is studied for the first time on Flemish Cap and is estimated to be about eight months.},

Over 88\% of the production was by suspension feeders of which the horse mussel, Modiolus modiolus (Linnaeus, 1758), was by far the largest contributor. The geographic distribution of production of the major, soft-sediment, epi- and infaunal trophic groups in the lower Bay of Fundy was in general agreement with the hypothesis that tidal currents are a major determinant of benthic distribution and production in the lower Bay. Tidal currents control sediment dynamics, as well as settlement, growth, and feeding of benthic animals.},

Presented here is a preliminary attempt to use modern surﬁcial geological techniques, including sidescan sonar and a high resolution seismic reﬂection system to map the distribution of bivalve reefs in the Bay of Fundy. Acoustic techniques were groundtruthed with a 0.5-m2 video grab. The grab jaws could be hydaulically closed from the deploying vessel on the basis of a video view of the sediment from a camera focused between the grab jaws. Sampling was limited to the upper Bay of Fundy where ﬁve geological provinces were recognized. Preliminary results show that horse mussels are limited to the harder, more stable sedimentary provinces (gravel/cobble and mottled gravel), but also to an intermediate province: sand with bioherms. The latter are raised features formed by the horse mussels on megarippled sand which are long and thin, and ﬂow-parallel structures covered with epifauna. Although positive, the present data are insufﬁcient to conclude whether acoustic methods can signiﬁcantly improve on conventional benthic grab sampling methods to map benthic production.},

This study combined (i) new survey data (a dedicated multibeam echosounder survey of the Lough), (ii) a habitat suitability model for M. modiolus with (iii) historical diver surveys to estimate the extent and abundance before 1986 (before the suspected period of greatest decline), 2003 (during the introduction of a ban on mobile fishing gear in the Lough) and 2007 (the most recent diver survey available). Estimations indicate that the extent reduced from approximately 12.6km2 in 1986 to just 5.7km2 by 2007 and the abundance declined by 87\% in the same period. The decline has implications both for the remaining population of M. modiolus and ecosystem functionality within the Lough, which are both discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {Onega Bay is the largest bay in the White Sea, characterised by shallow depth, a range of sediment types and strong tidal currents. All these factors provide conditions for high species richness and biomass. This study reviews data from three surveys of sublittoral macrobenthos undertaken by Russian institutes: the benthic survey covering the entire Onega Bay in 1952; the survey performed in the northern part of the area in 1981 ⁄ 90, and a study carried out in 2006 in the eastern part of the bay. In total, data from 107 stations were analysed. The data in different surveys were collected by different grab types. The datasets of both 1981 ⁄ 90 and 2006 overlap the 1952 survey area. The pattern of biomass distribution was consistent between the years of survey and was characterised by the low biomass at the northern periphery of the bay and the highest biomass observed in the coastal waters of the Solovetsky Islands. Bivalves and cirripeds (mostly Modiolus modiolus, Arctica islandica, Balanus balanus and Verucca stroemia) dominated in biomass. Neither the biomass share of dominant species nor the frequency of occurrence of several common species in these groups changed markedly between 1952 and 1981 ⁄ 90. Although the results of the 2006 survey appear somewhat different from the patterns of previous years, this does not indicate major changes in the benthic communities, because the survey in 2006 was designed in a different way and its overlap with the 1952 survey was minimal. However, the dominant species (by biomass) –A. islandica, M. modiolus and V. stroemia – held their leading positions. Results of the multidimensional scaling analysis based on the biomass data for all taxa encountered in the 1952 survey indicate considerable mixing of the samples from all surveys. This may be interpreted as the absence of major shifts in the sublittoral communities of the macrobenthos of Onega Bay at decadal scale. This kind of stability may be explained by an oceanographical regime resilient to climate variation and a relatively low anthropogenic environmental impact when compared to other shallow European seas.},

	abstract = {During 2010 a set of 22 voluntary closed areas, distributed around Shetland, were proposed by local industry in order to help protect and conserve threatened habitats from potential physical disturbance from scallop dredging. Initially, closed areas were implemented on a precautionary basis over predicted beds of maerl and horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) derived from historical data. Horse mussel and maerl beds are classed as priority habitats which have been identiﬁed as being threatened and requiring conservation under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). Legalisation of the voluntarily adopted closed areas occurred in 2011. Detailed surveys were conducted to map each closed area with speciﬁc reference to the deﬁning features located within. Closed areas were surveyed using a hull mounted multibeam system and ground-truthed with an underwater camera system. Information was imported to a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to create georeferenced habitat maps of the two species of interest. The appropriateness of each closed area was assessed and a proposed methodology and procedure outlined for any future closed areas. The primary aim was to provide information on which to test the validity of initial closed area boundaries and subsequently allow managers to reﬁne and add to them in the future. The survey illustrated the need to have good quality acoustic and visual survey work undertaken whenever areas have been closed based on historical data and/or predicted habitats. Predicted beds were not found to be representative of the survey ﬁndings. The survey highlighted the lack of good quality, robust, accurate, and up to date species information for the waters around Shetland, especially with regard to priority marine features. Although some were neither fully protecting the UK BAP habitats they were designed to protect nor were protecting any UK BAP habitats, a degree of protection had been conferred to some priority features in the ﬁrst iteration of implementation of closed areas. Survey data were subsequently used to legally alter the closed area boundaries to more appropriately reﬂect the distribution of priority features. Recommendations were made on appropriate procedures for deﬁning a species bed and on the wider implications of the study’s ﬁndings for other ﬁsheries areas developing spatial management plans.},

	abstract = {The macrotidal Bay of Fundy, Canada, was systematically mapped in the early 2000s using multibeam sonar technology, partly to support efforts to develop hydropower. The primary product was a suite of 1:50,000-scale maps of shaded seaﬂoor relief and backscatter. In addition, a ‘seascape’ map was produced in an attempt to classify the entire bay in terms of morphology, texture, and biota. The eight seascape groups that are delineated reﬂect the strong signature of glaciation in much of the bay, the effects of Holocene tidal range expansion, and the results of modern processes under a dynamic current regime. As a result of the recent mapping we are able to argue that the muddy depocentre in the southwest of the bay was primarily active before the well-documented expansion of tidal range that occurred in the Bay of Fundy in the Holocene epoch. We further demonstrate the complexity of the seaﬂoor in one of the glacial seascapes, and discuss the morphology and stability of a major tidal scour. The evidence obtained from multibeam sonar mapping reveals the complexity of the sea ﬂoor in the Bay of Fundy not necessarily apparent on the 1977 surﬁcial geology map based on sparse lines of single-beam echo sounder data.},

These two bivalve species were exposed to four concentrations of seston (1, 3, 7, and 14 mg l−1) at each of three levels of organic quality (25, 50 and 80\% POM). Experimental diets consisted of mixtures of microalgae and silica at concentrations typical of those observed in their natural habitats. Clearance rates for both species decreased as the concentration and organic content of the seston increased. Both species have the ability to reject poorer quality inorganic particles, through the production of pseudofaeces, and significantly improve the quality of the particles ingested. The ability to select organic particles over inorganic ones was independent of seston concentration but diminished as the organic content of the seston decreased. When exposed to increasing seston concentrations, scallops reduce clearance rates and increase pseudofaeces production resulting in maximum ingestion rates at approximately 7 mg l−1. Clams also reduce clearance rates as concentration increased but maintain low pseudofaeces rejection rates thus enabling ingestion to continue to increase to at least 14 mg l−1. M. arenaria appears to be better suited than P. magellanicus to ingest organic material at higher concentrations of low quality seston.},

	abstract = {Reduction of bycatch through spatial management is one possible approach in fisheries management. One requirement is description of the habitat of the species in question, and this is now possible for a range of species using data collected from electronic tags. Here we report on a spatial management approach used to limit unwanted capture of southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) in the eastern Australia longline fishery. The approach combines a habitat model conditioned with temperature preference data from 56 pop-up satellite archival tags deployed on SBT, and an ocean model to produce near real-time habitat predictions utilized by fishery managers during the fishing season. Three habitat types based on probability of SBT occurrence are identified in the fishing region, and spatial zoning by managers is used to regulate fisher access to these zones. This management approach has been used since 2003, and despite dynamic spatial management often being resisted by fishers or managers because of perceived implementation complexity, there has been an increase in complexity of the management actions over the 6-yr period. Managers now request more habitat predictions each season, update the spatial zoning more frequently, and apply more complicated management lines dividing the habitat types. This has resulted in an improved fit to the modeled habitat predictions, and as catch per unit effort (CPUE) of SBT is related to the habitat type, has contributed to the overall success of the management approach. This implemented management approach illustrates that managers and fishers can successfully implement complex dynamic spatial zoning.},

	abstract = {Many fisheries around the world are plagued with the problem of bycatch—the inadvertent harvesting and discard of non-targeted species. Bycatch occurs when targeted and non-targeted species coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and non-targeted species, and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators.},

The primary elements of these regulatory regimes are then compared. In general, management authorities did not develop coherent policies that reconciled conflicting social and economic aspirations and, as a result, in the 1980s most fleets were overcapitalized, exploitation rates were high for most of the important groundfish stocks, enforcement of regulations was difficult, and non-compliance was a serious problem in many regimes. Most regimes have adopted new regulatory approaches in the 1990s.},

Traditionally, the New Bedford Style dredge (New Bedford dredge) has been used by the commercial fleet; however, since 2013, the Coonamessett Farm Turtle Deflector Dredge (turtle dredge) has been required seasonally in the Mid-Atlantic region to minimize the capture of sea turtles. This analysis provides estimates of selectivity and relative efficiency for the turtle dredge and the New Bedford dredge. Selectivity information for the turtle dredge is currently unknown, and selectivity for the New Bedford dredge was originally assessed in 2008. The Share Each Lengths Catch Total method was used to model scallop catch-at-length data for each commercial dredge with data collected during the Virginia Institute of Marine Science fishery-independent surveys in 2015 to 2017, conducted onboard commercial fishing vessels. The surveys were conducted in the Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank regions of the resource in three distinct areas. A paired study design was used, where a nonselective National Marine Fisheries Service sea scallop survey dredge and either the turtle dredge or New Bedford dredge were towed simultaneously at each survey station. To assess for time-varying changes in selectivity, results were compared with the 2008 New Bedford dredge analysis. Results indicated the 50\% retention length was 98.2 mm, with a selection range of 28.2 mm and a relative efficiency of 0.83 for the turtle dredge. New Bedford dredge results estimated a 50\% retention length of 107.4 mm, selection range of 50.5 mm and relative efficiency of 0.81. Comparing selectivity profiles for the turtle dredge and New Bedford dredge with the 2008 results indicated a shift toward increased retention probability for smaller size classes of scallops.},

	abstract = {In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL), there is a mostly supplementary fishery for sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) concentrated on three primary scallop beds in the Northumberland Strait. The fishery is not subject to an enforced minimum size limit and small scallops ({\textless}90 mm shell height) are often removed from this population before they have had time to adequately contribute to population recruitment, resulting in sub-optimal fishery yields and a partially size-suppressed population. This study aimed to provide stakeholders with information related to gear configuration changes that could potentially reduce catches of small scallops in the sGSL fishery by quantifying size-selectivity of different ring sizes (82.6 mm and 88.9 mm) and washer types (rubber and steel). We also compared the catches of small, fecund scallops (45–90 mm) across the different gear configurations. The gears with 82.6 mm rings had high retention of small scallops, with lengths of 50 \% retention estimated to be 72.8 and 76.0 mm with rubber and steel washers, respectively. This increased to 87.9 mm and 95.5 mm, respectively, in the gears with 88.9 mm rings. It was estimated that with rubber washers, increasing ring size from 82.6 mm to 88.9 mm will reduce catch of small fecund scallops by 51 \%, while reducing catch of large scallops by 27 \%. Increasing ring size was more effective than changing washer type at increasing size selectivity of the gear. Previous research on scallop life history suggests that this reduction of large scallops will be temporary because the larger gear will ultimately shift the population size distribution towards larger scallops resulting in higher yield-per-recruit. These results will be useful to resource managers and stakeholders for stock assessments, and for future gear type decisions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Fisheries scientists and managers must track rapid shifts in fish spatial distribution to mitigate stakeholder conflict and optimize survey designs, and these spatial shifts result in part from animal movement. Information regarding animal movement can be obtained from selection experiments, tagging studies, flux through movement gates (e.g. acoustic arrays), fishery catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), resource surveys and genetic/chemical markers. However, there are few accessible approaches to combine these data types while accounting for spatially correlated residual patterns. We therefore discuss a movement model involving diffusion (random movement), taxis (movement towards preferred habitat) and advection (passive drift following ocean currents). We specifically outline how these movement processes can be fitted to data while discretizing space and time and estimating non-linear habitat preferences using environmental layers as well as spatial process errors. Finally, we introduce an R package, ATM, by fitting the model to bottom trawl survey, longline fishery and tagging data for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus, Gadidae) in the Bering Sea during winter/summer seasons from 1982 to 2019. Combining data types predicts an increasing proportion of cod residing in the northern Bering Sea from 2013 to 2019, and estimates are informative in a recent stock assessment model. We fit sensitivity analyses by dropping tag, survey or fishery data, and this analysis shows that tagging data are necessary to identify diffusion rates, while survey data are informative about movement among biogeographic strata. This “hybrid” species distribution model can help explain poleward movement, project distributions under future climate conditions and evaluate alternative tag-deployment scenarios to optimize tagging designs.},

which dates back to Pierre- Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates
the integrand with a second order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes
the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical
idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain
the approach of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) to do
approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs
represent an important model-abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a
large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we will
discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA-approach, the R-INLA package,
why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute and why
LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

	abstract = {Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99\% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region’s Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management.
Double jeopardy
In the best of worlds, exploited fish stocks are monitored so that harvest quotas protect the reproductive ability of the population. Climate change is likely to complicate this process substantially. Pershing et al. found that cod stocks declined continuously during intense warming in the North Atlantic. Fisheries quotas, even though they were responsibly set and followed by fishers, decreased the reproductive rate. Thus, managing fisheries in a warming world is going to be increasingly problematic.

Previous research has mainly focused on how species' ranges will respond to changing ocean temperatures, without accounting for other environmental covariates that could affect future distribution patterns. Here, we integrate habitat suitability modeling approaches, a high-resolution global climate model projection, and detailed fishery-independent and -dependent faunal datasets from one of the most extensively monitored marine ecosystems?the U.S. Northeast Shelf. We project the responses of 125 species in this region to climate-driven changes in multiple oceanographic factors (e.g., ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height) and seabed characteristics (i.e., rugosity and depth). Comparing model outputs based on ocean temperature and seabed characteristics to those that also incorporated salinity and sea surface height (proxies for primary productivity and ocean circulation features), we explored how an emphasis on ocean temperature in projecting species' range shifts can impact assessments of species' climate vulnerability. We found that multifactor habitat suitability models performed better in explaining and predicting species historical distribution patterns than temperature-based models. We also found that multifactor models provided more concerning assessments of species' future distribution patterns than temperature-based models, projecting that species' ranges will largely shift northward and become more contracted and fragmented over time. Our results suggest that using ocean temperature as a primary determinant of range shifts can significantly alter projections, masking species' climate vulnerability, and potentially forestalling proactive management.},

However, it is a challenge to integrate climate change information in a form that can be used efficiently by adaptation planners, policy makers and fishery managers. In this study, we frame a climate change impact assessment using a geographical perspective based on the management units of the dominant fishery, in this case, American lobster in Nova Scotia, Canada. The information considered here includes economic dependence on the fishery, population size, diversity of the fishery revenue, status of harbour infrastructure, total replacement cost of each harbour, increased relative sea level and flooding, and the vulnerability of offshore lobster to ocean warming and changes in zooplankton composition and anticipatory changes in fishery productivity across management borders. Using two ocean models to provide multi-decadal scale projections of bottom temperature, changes in offshore lobster distribution are projected to have a neutral, or positive impact on the region as a whole. However, when lobster vulnerability is combined with climate change related vulnerabilities of coastal fishing communities, it is evident that adaptation planning is needed for long-term sustainability. This impact assessment provides both a framework and information for further in-depth analyses by climate change adaptation planners and fishery managers.},

	abstract = {Coming up with Bayesian models for spatial data is easy, but performing
inference with them can be challenging. Writing fast inference code for a
complex spatial model with realistically-sized datasets from scratch is
time-consuming, and if changes are made to the model, there is little guarantee
that the code performs well. The key advantages of R-INLA are the ease with
which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write
complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial
problems with hundreds of thousands of observations.
  R-INLA handles latent Gaussian models, where fixed effects, structured and
unstructured Gaussian random effects are combined linearly in a linear
predictor, and the elements of the linear predictor are observed through one or
more likelihoods. The structured random effects can be both standard areal
model such as the Besag and the BYM models, and geostatistical models from a
subset of the Matérn Gaussian random fields. In this review, we discuss the
large success of spatial modelling with R-INLA and the types of spatial models
that can be fitted, we give an overview of recent developments for areal
models, and we give an overview of the stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE) approach and some of the ways it can be extended beyond the assumptions
of isotropy and separability. In particular, we describe how slight changes to
the SPDE approach leads to straight-forward approaches for non-stationary
spatial models and non-separable space-time models.},

	abstract = {A common goal in ecology and its applications is to better understand how species' distributions change over space and time, yet many conventional summary metrics (e.g. center of gravity) of distribution shifts may offer limited inference because such changes may not be spatially homogenous. We develop a modeling approach to estimate a spatially explicit temporal trend (i.e. local trend), alongside spatial (temporally constant) and spatiotemporal (time-varying) components, to compare inferred spatial shifts to those indicated by conventional metrics. This method is generalizable to many data types including presence–absence data, count data and continuous data types such as density. To demonstrate the utility of this new approach, we focus on the application of this model to a community of well-studied marine fish species on the US west coast (19 species, representing a wide range of presence–absence and densities). Results from conventional model selection indicate that the use of the model accounting for local trends is clearly justified for over 89\% of these species. In addition to making more parsimonious and accurate predictions, we illustrate how estimated spatial fields from the local trend model can be used to classify regions within the species range where change is relatively homogenous. Conventional summary metrics, such as center of gravity, can then be calculated on each such region or within previously defined biogeographic boundaries. We use this approach to illustrate that change is more nuanced than what is expressed via global metrics. Using arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias as an example, the observed southward shift over time in the center of gravity is not reflective of a uniform shift in densities but local trends of decreasing density in the northern region and rapidly increasing density at the southern edge of the species' range. Thus, estimating local trends with spatiotemporal models improves interpretation of species distribution change.},

But how reliable an indicator of extinction risk is a single estimate of population trend? Given the integral role this decline-based approach has played in setting conservation priorities, it is surprising that it has undergone little empirical scrutiny. We compile an extensive global dataset of time series of abundance data for over 1300 vertebrate populations to provide the first major test of the predictability of population growth rates in nature. We divided each time series into assessment and response periods and examined the correlation between growth rates in the two time periods. In birds, population declines tended to be followed by further declines, but mammals, salmon, and other bony fishes showed the opposite pattern: past declines were associated with subsequent population increases, and vice versa. Furthermore, in these taxa subsequent growth rates were higher when initial declines were more severe. These patterns agreed with data simulated under a null model for a dynamically stable population experiencing density dependence. However, this type of result could also occur if conservation actions positively affected the population following initial declines—a scenario that our data were too limited to rigorously evaluate. This ambiguity emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying causes of population trajectories in drawing inferences about rates of decline in abundance.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity was established in 1993. Canada is a signatory nation that has adopted, and exceeded, the UN Aichi biodiversity target to protect 10\% of coastal and marine areas through marine protected areas or “other effective area-based conservation measures” (OECMs) by 2020. However, the science of OECMs as contributors to biodiversity conservation is relatively young and their definition and efficacy testing continue to evolve. Here, we examine whether areas closed to fishing on the Scotian Shelf in Atlantic Canada, where the groundfish community had collapsed in the early 1990s, have the potential to serve as OECMs for groundfish recovery. Using long-term research survey data, we show that 3 long-term area-based fishing fleet closures did not enhance per capita population growth rates of the majority of 24 common groundfish species. At a regional scale, 10 out of 24 species are currently at less than 50\% of their pre-collapse (1979-1992) biomass, reflecting a sustained diminished productivity, even though fishing mortality has been drastically reduced through a moratorium in 1993. Additional measures are needed to protect severely depleted groundfish, especially when the causes of continued diminished productivity are still largely unresolved. The importance of OECMs as a risk-averse approach towards sustainability is globally accepted and they can be considered a tool towards the overarching UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-14). Our study provides further impetus towards articulating the criteria of OECMs and improving their design, monitoring, and testing, while placing OECMs within the broader context of sustainable ecosystem-based management.},

Additionally, the relative amount of stock-level catch reporting errors was estimated from the differences between the VMS-based method and reported VTR landings. While the VMS methods can be imprecise, they are useful for detecting shifts in reporting patterns over time and estimating the general scale of the errors. Results show the difference in VMS estimated catch and VTR reported catch changing markedly beginning in fishing year 2010 for several of the quota-limited stocks. These discrepancies occurred despite marginal improvements in compliance with VTR area fished reporting requirements over the same time period. For the majority of the stocks examined, the overall error is estimated to be small and may not substantially impact resource monitoring and stock assessment efforts; however for some stocks the estimated errors are large in one or more years (Eastern Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine cod, Gulf of Maine haddock, Southern New England/Mid-Atlantic winter flounder). While the impacts on some stocks may be large, the magnitude in terms of number of vessels contributing to the overall error is small. Much of the error could be mitigated through improvements in catch monitoring and/or management measures designed to improve catch accounting.

	abstract = {This scallop fishery has taken place in the portion of Scallop Fishing Area (SFA) 29 west of longitude 65°30′ W since 2001 and is currently conducted by two fleets: the Full Bay Fleet and a limited number of inshore East of Baccaro licence holders. As of 2010, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and landings are reported for both fleets combined. In 2012, a total of 167.2 t was landed against the TAC of 160 t. There was an additional Food, Social and Ceremonial catch of 4.7 t. From 2011 to 2012, catch rates declined or stayed the same in subareas A, C, D and E, but increased by over 40\% in subarea B. In 2012, there was an increase in the mean number of commercial scallops in the survey for subareas A, B, and D, and no change in C. The number of recruit size scallops per tow increased in subareas A, B, and C, but did not change in D. Prerecruits showed an increase in all subareas. The mean weight per tow and survey biomass increased in subareas A to D from 2011 to 2012. Condition factors increased in subareas A to D, but the increase was less dramatic in subarea D. Some of the highest growth rates for SFA 29 West were observed in 2012, particularly in subarea B. Two methods were used to estimate exploitation rates in SFA 29 West: one from commercial catch rates, representing more localized conditions, and one from the research survey, representing broader conditions. Trends in annual total fishing effort (hours fished) were also presented since effort is assumed to be directly related to fishing mortality. From 2011 to 2012, effort decreased in subareas A and D by 94 and 48\%, respectively, while smaller decreases in effort were recorded for subareas B (10\%) and C (12\%). Exploitation estimates generally indicated a decrease in all subareas in 2012. A total TAC similar to that in 2012 is recommended. A reduction in TAC in subarea C would promote recovery of this area, and an increase in TAC in subarea B would be consistent with the observed increase in abundance and biomass in this area. The estimated number of lobster caught represents 0.01\% of the lobsters caught in the 2011/2012 Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34 lobster fishery and 0.05\% of the lobsters caught in the area of LFA 34 corresponding to SFA 29 West. In 2012, it is estimated that 4,302 lobsters were caught during the SFA 29 West scallop fishery; 940 were dead or injured.},

	abstract = {The frequently observed positive relationship between fish population abundance and spatial distribution suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan based solely on the SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 demersal populations (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism. Innovation First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

	abstract = {Which management actions work best to prevent or halt overfishing and to rebuild depleted populations? A comprehensive evaluation of multiple, co-occurring management actions on the sustainability status of marine populations has been lacking. Here we compiled detailed management histories for 288 assessed fisheries from around the world (accounting for 45\% of those with formal stock assessments) and used hierarchical time-series analyses to estimate effects of different management interventions on trends in stock status. Rebuilding plans, applied less commonly than other management measures (implemented at some point historically for 43\% of stocks), rapidly lowered fishing pressure towards target levels and emerged as the most important factor enabling overfished populations to recover. Additionally, the ratification of international fishing agreements, and harvest control rules specifying how catch limits should vary with population biomass, helped to reduce overfishing and rebuild biomass. Notably, we found that benefits of management actions are cumulative—as more are implemented, stock status improves and predicted long-term catches increase. Thus, a broad suite of management measures at local, national and international levels appears to be key to sustaining fish populations and food production. Wise management is critical to sustaining fisheries. This study finds that rebuilding plans, ratification of international agreements and harvest control rules yield strong benefits and that these are cumulative.},

	abstract = {The continuous, synoptical and high spatio-temporal resolution of thermal and visible satellite observations constitute an asset when characterizing and monitoring biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value {\textless}0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r2 = 0.64, MAPD = 7\%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r2 = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7\%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.},

	abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock’ paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (age-size/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood’ paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is well-documented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

            Recruitment is one of the dominant processes regulating fish population productivity. It is, however, notoriously difficult to predict, as it is the result of a complex multi-step process. Various fine-scale drivers might act on the pathway from adult population characteristics to spawning behaviour and egg production, and then to recruitment. Here, we provide a holistic analysis of the Northwest Atlantic mackerel recruitment process from 1982 to 2017 and exemplify why broad-scale recruitment–environment relationships could become unstable over time. Various demographic and environmental drivers had a synergetic effect on recruitment, but larval survival through a spatio-temporal match with prey was shown to be the key process. Recruitment was also mediated by maternal effects and a parent–offspring fitness trade-off due to the different feeding regimes of adults and larvae. A mismatch curtails the effects of high larval prey densities, so that despite the abundance of food in recent years, recruitment was relatively low and the pre-existing relationship with overall prey abundance broke down. Our results reaffirm major recruitment hypotheses and demonstrate the importance of fine-scale processes along the recruitment pathway, helping to improve recruitment predictions and potentially fisheries management.},

Fisheries Investigations, 2: 533 pp.) monograph contributed a widely used stock–recruitment relationship (BH-SRR) to fisheries science. However, because of variation around a presumed relationship between spawning biomass and recruits, the BH-SRR is often considered inadequate and approached merely as a curve-fitting exercise. The commonly used and simplified version of the BH-SRR has eclipsed the fact that in their classic monograph, the derivation accounted for mechanistic recruitment processes, including multi-stage recruitment with explicit cohort-dependent and -independent mortality terms that represent competition between recruits and extrinsic, cohort-independent factors such as the environment or predation as two independent sources of mortality. The original BH-SRR allows one to recreate recruitment patterns that correspond to observed ones. Doing so shows that variation in density-independent mortality increases the probability of overlooking an underlying stock–recruitment relationship. Intermediate coefficients of variation in mortality (75–100\%) are sufficient to mask stock–recruitment relationships and recreate recruitment time series most similar to empirical data. This underlines the importance of variation in survival for recruitment and that Beverton and Holt’s work still provides a fundamental and useful tool to model the dynamics of populations.},

	abstract = {The Beverton–Holt and Ricker stock-recruit functions were derived in terms of two pre-recruit mortality parameters. Mace, \& Doonan, (1988, A generalized bioeconomic simulation model for fish population dynamics) reparameterized the stock-recruit function in terms of steepness, which combines pre-recruit mortality with post-recruit biological parameters defining unfished spawning biomass per recruit. Their parameterization explicitly assumes a stable age distribution at unexploited conditions, but also implicitly assumes that unexploited spawning biomass per recruit is time invariant. Temporal variation could occur in either pre-recruit mortality rates or post-recruit biological parameters, but different dynamics are produced. The former results in variation in both the stock-recruit curve and the population equilibria, whereas variation in the latter only changes the points of equilibria on the curve. Thus, variation in either pre- or post-recruit parameters will result in variation in steepness, maximum sustainable yield and associated management reference points. Empirical measures of components of post-recruit productivity (maturity and mass at age, e.g.) are available for many managed fish stocks and often exhibit temporal variability. Yet use of the steepness parameterization requires an analyst to specify one set of post-recruit biological parameters to define unexploited spawning biomass per recruit for the full time series. This misspecification leads to misperception of biological reference points and has implications for meta-analyses of steepness, and interpretation of the dynamic concept. Returning to the original parameterization allows the isolation of any temporal or inter-population variation in pre- and post-recruit productivity and reduces the potential for mechanistic bias in stock-recruit parameters.},

Fisheries scientists often assume the number of young fish entering a population (recruitment) is related to the biomass of spawning adults and that recruitment dynamics do not change over time. Thus, managers often use a target biomass based on spawning biomass as the basis for calculating sustainable catches. However, we show recruitment and spawning biomass are not positively related over the observed range of stock sizes for 61\% of 224 stocks in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database. Furthermore, 85\% of stocks for which spawning biomass may not drive recruitment dynamics over the observed ranges exhibit shifts in average recruitment, which is often used in proxies for target biomasses. Our results suggest that the environment more strongly influences recruitment than spawning biomass over the observed stock sizes for many stocks. Management often endeavours to maintain stock sizes within the observed ranges, so methods for setting management targets that include changes within an ecosystem may better define the status of some stocks, particularly as climate changes.},

SSB is assumed to be a proxy for stock reproductive potential (SRP). Limit reference points based on SSB are used to indicate the level of biomass below which productivity is affected. SSB fails to account for changes in fecundity, egg viability and sex ratio, and it has been argued that total egg production (TEP) provides a better reflection of SRP. We explore how accounting for TEP impacts limit reference points and evidence for a relationship between stock and recruit. Time series of SSB and TEP are compared for three North Sea stocks: cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Dynamics based on TEP are different from those based on SSB for cod and plaice, but the stock–recruit relationships were not ‘improved’ using TEP. Shifts in productivity (spawner per recruit) occur in all three time series and SSB underestimated uncertainty. Yet again, it was shown that assumptions of stationarity about fish population productivity are incorrect. We argue that the use of TEP does improve the realism in our understanding of stock dynamics, and demographically, more complex management strategy evaluation is required to develop management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and integrate F and the demographic health of a stock. Empirical feedback control systems based on fisheries independent indices including surveys of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or spawning adults should be evaluated and compared to traditional approaches.},

Can stock–recruitment points determine which spawning potential ratio is the best proxy for maximum sustainable yield reference points? – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1075–1080.The approach of examining scatter plots of stock–recruitment (S–R) estimates to determine appropriate spawning potential ratio (SPR)-based proxies for FMSY was investigated through simulation. As originally proposed, the approach assumed that points above a replacement line indicate year classes that produced a surplus of spawners, while points below that line failed to achieve replacement. In practice, this has been implemented by determining Fmed, the fishing mortality rate that produces a replacement line with 50\% of the points above and 50\% below the line. A new variation on this approach suggests FMSY proxies can be determined by examining the distribution of S–R points that are above or below replacement lines associated with specific SPRs. Through both analytical calculations and stochastic results, we demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed and that in some cases the inference is diametrically opposed to the method's intended purpose. We reject this approach as a tool for determining FMSY proxies. We recommend that the current proxy of F40\% be maintained as appropriate for a typical groundfish life history.},

Model and parametric uncertainty is jointly characterised and the challenge of addressing model selection when the model itself is part of the hierarchy is addressed using the deviance information criterion (DIC) and posterior predictive analysis. For the six herring stocks the across-stock posterior evidence in favour of over-compensatory dynamics is fairly strong, with the Ricker and Shepherd models performing the best across the model-selection criteria. For a specific model form we perform a 20 year retrospective analysis (hierarchical and non-hierarchical) to see how temporal information flow occurs in a hierarchical framework, how this can improve our estimates of key parameters, and how this might influence management paradigms (such as Maximum Sustainable Yield) that are based on such estimates.},

Steepness is defined as the fraction of recruitment from a virgin population obtained when the spawners are at 20\% of the virgin level. Steepness directly relates to productivity and yield and is an important element in the calculation of many management reference points. Stock–recruitment relationships have traditionally been estimated from time series of recruitment and spawning biomass, but recently interest has arisen regarding the ability to estimate steepness inside fishery stock assessment models. We evaluated the ability to estimate steepness of the Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment relationship using simulation analyses for twelve US Pacific Coast fish stocks. A high proportion of steepness estimates from the simulated data and the original data occur at the bounds for steepness and the proportion decreased as the true steepness decreased. The simulation results indicate that, in most cases, steepness was estimated with moderate to low precision and moderate to high bias. The poorly estimated steepness indicates that often there is little information in the data about this quantity. However, reliable estimation is attainable with a good contrast of spawning stock biomass for relatively unproductive stocks when the model is correctly specified.},

Their effective conservation requires predictions of sensitivity and exposure to fishing mortality, but such predictions are hard to make when the population dynamics of most of these species have not been described. 2. We present a method for assessing sensitivity and conservation management reference points using widely available life-history data. The method allows the sensitivity of all fish species in a community to be assessed in relation to conservation- and yield-based fishery reference points. 3. Knowledge of sensitivity is used to (i) rank species by sensitivity, (ii) conduct a risk assessment to identify species potentially vulnerable to current fishing pressure and (iii) examine potential trade-offs between fishery catches and the conservation status of sensitive species. 4. The method is applied to the Celtic Sea bottom-dwelling fish community. For the species present, conservation threshold fishing mortalities ranged from 0·05 per year for the most sensitive large elasmobranchs to over 1 per year for small teleosts. The assessment predicts that current levels of fishing mortality may place all the elasmobranchs and over a quarter of the teleosts below conservation reference points. 5. Depending on the relative mortality rates affecting commercially targeted species and species of conservation concern, up to 65\% of the potential yield-per-recruit of commercially important species may have to be forgone to reduce fishing mortality below conservation limit reference points for the most sensitive species. 6. Synthesis and applications. The method presented provides a clear objective procedure to construct ranked species sensitivity lists that can inform management, monitoring and research. The Celtic Sea case study demonstrated that limiting fishing pressure on key commercial stocks to meet fisheries production targets may be insufficient to guarantee the persistence of more sensitive species. Management actions that effectively decouple the mortality rates on commercial species and ‘conservation’ species are likely to be required to make progress in relation to conservation objectives. The method would support rapid assessment of sensitivity to fishing in many regions around the world as only taxonomic lists and estimates of body size are required.},

	abstract = {Scientists and resource managers need to know life history parameters (e.g., average mortality rate, individual growth rate, maximum length or mass, and timing of maturity) to understand and respond to risks to natural populations and ecosystems. For over 100 years, scientists have identified “life history invariants” (LHI) representing pairs of parameters whose ratio is theorized to be constant across species. LHI then promise to allow prediction of many parameters from field measurements of a few important traits. Using LHI in this way, however, neglects any residual patterns in parameters when making predictions. We therefore apply a multivariate model for eight variables (seven parameters and temperature) in over 32,000 fishes, and include taxonomic structure for residuals (with levels for class, order, family, genus, and species). We illustrate that this approach predicts variables probabilistically for taxa with many or few data. We then use this model to resolve three questions regarding life history parameters in fishes. Specifically we show that (1) on average there is a 1.24\% decrease in the Brody growth coefficient for every 1\% increase in maximum size; (2) the ratio of natural mortality rate and growth coefficient is not an LHI but instead varies systematically based on the timing of maturation, where movement along this life history axis is predictably correlated with species taxonomy; and (3) three variables must be known per species to precisely predict remaining life history variables. We distribute our predictive model as an R package, FishLife, to allow future life history predictions for fishes to be conditioned on taxonomy and life history data for fishes worldwide. This package also contains predictions (and predictive intervals) for mortality, maturity, size, and growth parameters for all described fishes.},

Trait-based approaches can provide better insight than species-based (i.e. taxonomic) approaches into community assembly and ecosystem functioning, but comparing species and trait dynamics may reveal important patterns for understanding community responses to environmental change. Here, we used a 33-year database of fish monitoring to compare the spatio-temporal dynamics of taxonomic and trait structure in North Sea fish communities. We found that the majority of variation in both taxonomic and trait structure was explained by a pronounced spatial gradient, with distinct communities in the southern and northern North Sea related to depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and bed shear stress. Both taxonomic and trait structure changed significantly over time; however taxonomically, communities in the south and north diverged towards different species, becoming more dissimilar over time, yet they converged towards the same traits regardless of species differences. In particular, communities shifted towards smaller, faster growing species with higher thermal preferences and pelagic water column position. Although taxonomic structure changed over time, its spatial distribution remained relatively stable, whereas in trait structure, the southern zone of the North Sea shifted northward and expanded, leading to homogenization. Our findings suggest that global environmental change, notably climate warming, will lead to convergence towards traits more adapted for novel environments regardless of species composition.},

	abstract = {The development and implementation of a population supplementation and restoration plan for any endangered species should involve an understanding of the species’ habitat requirements prior to the release of any captive bred individuals. The freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera, has undergone dramatic declines over the last century and is now globally endangered. In Northern Ireland, the release of captive bred individuals is being used to support wild populations and repatriate the species in areas where it once existed. We employed a combination of maximum entropy modelling (MAXENT) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to identify ecological parameters necessary to support wild populations using GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale environmental parameters. The GIS-based landscape scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with altitude and soil characteristics including the carbon, clay, sand, and silt content. Notably, mussels were associated with a relatively narrow band of variance indicating that M. margaritifera has a highly specific landscape niche. The ground-truthed habitat scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with stable consolidated substrates, the extent of bankside trees, presence of indicative macrophyte species and fast flowing water. We propose a three phase conservation strategy for M. margaritifera identifying suitable areas within rivers that (i) have a high conservation value yet needing habitat restoration at a local level, (ii) sites for population supplementation of existing populations and (iii) sites for species reintroduction to rivers where the mussel historically occurred but is now locally extinct. A combined analytical approach including GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale models provides a robust method by which suitable release sites can be identified for the population supplementation and restoration of an endangered species. Our results will be highly influential in the future management of M. margaritifera in Northern Ireland.},

	abstract = {The globally distributed leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea is subject to fisheries bycatch throughout its range. Protection from fisheries within pelagic foraging habitats is difficult to achieve but may be more tractable when populations are concentrated near neritic breeding and nesting grounds. We used satellite telemetry to describe patterns of habitat utilization during the inter-nesting period for seven leatherback turtles nesting at Mayumba National Park in Gabon on the equatorial West African coast. The National Park includes critical nesting grounds and a marine protected area to 15 km offshore. Turtles dispersed widely from the nesting beach spending a mean of 62 ± SD 26\% of tracking time outside the confines of the National Park. This propensity to disperse is likely to increase the chance of deleterious interactions with fisheries in the region. Patterns of habitat utilization indicate the need for wider spatial scale planning on the West African continental shelf to enhance protection of leatherback turtles when they are seasonally occupying these habitats in great numbers for breeding and nesting.},

Persistently fastâ€growing individuals have a higher chance of reaching reproductive size, do so at a younger age, and therefore contribute disproportionately to population growth (Î»). Here we introduce a new approach to quantify this â€œfastâ€growth effect.â€ We propose using ageâ€sizeâ€structured matrix models in which persistently fast and slow growers are distinguished as they occur in relatively young and old age classes for a given size category. Lifeâ€cycle pathways involving fast growth can then be identified, and their contribution to Î» is quantified through loop analysis. We applied this approach to an example species, the tropical rainforest tree Cedrela odorata, that shows persistent growth variation among individuals. Loop analysis showed that juvenile trees reaching the 10â€cm diameter class at belowâ€median age contributed twice as much to Î» as slow juvenile growers. Fast growth to largerâ€diameter categories also contributed disproportionately to Î». The results were robust to changes in parameter values and lifeâ€history tradeâ€offs. These results show that the fastâ€growth effect can be strong in longâ€lived species. Persistent growth differences among individuals should therefore be accommodated for in demographic models and lifeâ€history studies.},

Development of specific immune response after vaccination against Yersinia ruckeri was assessed as likelihood of survival after challenge and antibody level. Cell wall strength was assessed by the erythrocyte fragility test, and occurrence of morphological changes in various body organs was investigated. In the present study, no significant increase in general or specific resistance to infection was seen. Fish fed diets with megadoses of vitamin C2 had increased antibody levels and higher incidence of degenerative changes in skeletal muscle. Omega-3 fatty acids exerted an immunosuppressive action with both significantly lower likelihood of survival and lower antibody levels. An increased incidence of degenerative changes was also observed. On the other hand, increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids increased erythrocyte cell wall strength.},

All parameters required to describe the population dynamics are simple properties of the distribution of these individual demographic contributions, which we call individual reproductive value. The asymptotic population growth rate in the average environment and the demographic and environmental variances are respectively the mean individual reproductive value over individuals through time and the variance within and between years. Our approach leads to an intuitive understanding of demographic and environmental variances in ageâ€structured populations and their decomposition into additive ageâ€specific components due to survival and reproduction. We show how to apply this approach to estimate the demographic and environmental variances and their components. The estimates are based on yearly random samples of individual vital rates and require no information about the total population size.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations located off Labrador and Northeastern Newfoundland (NAFO areas 2G-3L) have recently declined to the lowest levels of abundance on record. These ''northern'' cod have historically comprised several geographically recognizable populations with independent migratory life cycles on the shelf from the Grand Banks to Labrador. A reappraisal of past and recent work suggests that fundamental changes have taken place in the population dynamics of these cod during the past several decades. We focus on two key elements: distribution and recruitment. Distributions have become more southerly and recruitment failures prevail. We argue that these features are related and that northerly spawning and warm ocean conditions are prerequisites for strong recruitment. Cold ocean temperatures are associated with southerly distributions and poor recruitment. We propose the ''right site'' hypothesis, that egg and larval retention and survival are spatially dependent and that in cold years, spawning tends to occur at southerly locations where larval retention will be poor. We make several testable predictions: regeneration of the northern populations will occur slowly at time scales of decades, regeneration of southern populations will occur more quickly given warming conditions, and the 1991-93 year classes will be poor because of southerly distributions.},

	abstract = {Shifts in size structure have been documented for many commercially exploited marine fish stocks, thought to be attributed to size-selective harvesting practices coupled with changing oceanic conditions. Northwest Atlantic monkfish (Lophius americanus) is a commercially valued species in the United States that is commonly caught as bycatch in Canadian scallop and groundfish fisheries. This uniquely positioned stock is bisected by the Canadian–American jurisdictional boundary, with considerable differences in exploitation and management across its range. The status of this species was assessed two decades ago (2000) in the Maritimes region of Canada and more recently (2016) in the United States, with both countries reporting considerable decreases in the average and maximum size attained by fish. A comprehensive understanding of the magnitude of this size decrease and the drivers underlying these changes across this species’ range is lacking. Here, using 55 years of fishery-independent survey data, we apply a linear mixed effects model to quantify temporal changes in monkfish length frequencies. Widespread decreases were evident in both countries, with a 48\% reduction in historic body length, indicating that the large fish once prevalent in the 1970s have become uncommon. Length varied significantly as a function of seasonality and bottom temperature. Discrepancies exist in the average observed size between countries when controlling for year, season, and area; with monkfish observed by the United States trawl survey 6 cm larger on average than those observed by the Canadian trawl survey. The implications of this difference should be considered when combining fish length data from multiple surveys. Irrespective of survey differences, the truncation of size structure in Northwest Atlantic monkfish is significant and understanding how these drivers, among others hypothesized to affect size structure (e.g. fishing mortality, density dependence), are associated with population viability will be necessary to ensure its long-term sustainability.},

	abstract = {The degree to which a female partitions resources between fecundity and per offspring investment is a central question in life-history theory. Maternal effects may influence the nature of this tradeoff through their effect on per offspring investment and subsequent offspring fitness. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of female age and size on brood size (number of offspring), per offspring investment, and fitness in the polychaete Streblospio benedicti, Early stage embryos were collected from brooding females of known age and size over a period of 100 days; these embryos were counted and analyzed for their C and N content. Female size had a positive effect on brood size; larger females produced larger broods. However, brood size decreased with female age (females did not increase in size after reaching sexual maturity). Brood size declined 20-46{\textbackslash}\% between 60 and 160 days of age. During this same age period per offspring investment, measured in terms of C and N, increased by 25{\textbackslash}\%. Offspring survivorship and size at two weeks post-release from the female were used as measures of offspring fitness, Offspring survivorship increased 28{\textbackslash}\% between 60 and 160 days of age. Increased growth in offspring from older females resulted in a 23{\textbackslash}\% increase in offspring size at two weeks, Including the maternal age effect in two population models for S. benedicti increased population growth rate (lambda), Population growth was increased to a greater degree when the maternal effect was modeled by enhancing offspring survival compared to when fecundity was increased by the same proportional amount. This suggests that the maternal effect may be adaptive, particularly when conditions for offspring survival and growth are poor.},

Differences in growth rate are also shown for five haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), five saithe (Pollachius virens) and four whiting (Merlangius merlangus) stocks. Some of the inter-stock and inter-annual variability in growth rate can be related to temperature, as can inter-species variability at Faroe. Temperature during the first year has a strong influence on subsequent weight-at-age of cod in the North Sea and may account for much of the observed variability up to six years of age. The relationship between temperature and recruitment is weak for individual stocks of cod (with the exception of West Greenland), but when several stocks are looked at together a pattern emerges, in which recruitment is highest in the range 5–7°C. The problems of designing appropriate estimates of temperature for growth or recruitment studies are discussed in the light of recent work on fish distribution and behaviour. © 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAScod / growth / recruitment / temperature / North Atlantic
Résumé
Effets de la variabilité environnementale sur la croissance et le recrutement de la morue (Gadus Morhua). La croissance et le recrutement de dix stocks de morues sont comparés pour étudier la variabilité interannuelle et géographique ainsi que les effets de la température. Les données proviennent de cinq stocks d’églefins (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), cinq stocks de lieux noirs (Pollachius virens) et quatre stocks de merlans (Merlangius merlangus). La variabilité entre les stocks et les années dans le taux de croissance est en partie liée à la température, de même que la variabilité entre les espèces aux ı̂les Féroé. Pendant la première année, la température a un effet très marqué sur la relation entre le poids et l’âge de la morue dans la mer du Nord et peut constituer l'essentiel de la variabilité jusqu’à la sixième année. Le lien entre température et recrutement est faible à l'intérieur de chaque stock de morues, sauf à l'ouest du Groenland, mais la comparaison entre plusieurs stocks révèle un modèle où le recrutement est maximal entre 5 et 7°C. L'estimation des températures optimales dans les études de croissance ou de recrutement est discutée à la lumière des travaux récents sur la répartition et le comportement des poissons.},

	abstract = {Relative body size has long been recognized as a factor influencing reproductive success in fishes, but maternal age has only recently been considered. We monitored growth and starvation resistance in larvae from 20 female black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), ranging in age from five to 17 years. Larvae from the oldest females in our experiments had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. These results suggest that progeny from older females can survive under a broader range of environmental conditions compared to progeny from younger females. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations.},

	abstract = {We assessed the extent to which temperature interacts with maternal contributions to egg size to affect development time and size of yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferrugineus) larvae at hatch. Maternal effects contributed significantly to differences in egg sizes produced by four females. Eggs from each female were incubated at five temperatures. Development time was most significantly affected by temperature, and female effects were minimal. However, the variance in development time within a population was significantly affected by an interaction between female and temperature effects. Average length at hatch varied significantly among temperatures and females, as did the variance in hatching length within a population. Variance in hatching length explained by maternal effects peaked at intermediate temperatures (similar to 38{\textbackslash}\% explained variance at 7 degrees C), while variance explained by covariation with development time increased linearly with temperature, explaining similar to 40{\textbackslash}\% variance at 13 degrees C. Overall, the nonadditive interaction between maternal contributions and the environment suggests that female effects must be considered over the entire range of environmental conditions experienced by their progeny. In addition, our results support the idea that it is inappropriate to quantify female effects among eggs and extrapolate these differences to larvae.},

All the phospholipids of heart and liver from SO-fed fish had increased levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:2(n-6) and 20:3(n-6); phosphatidyl choline (PC) and phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) also had increased 20:4(n-6). There was a general decrease in 20:5(n-3) in the phospholipids, reflected in an increase in the 20:4(n-6)/20:5(n-3) ratio, especially in PC and PE. The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids from brain and retina were much less affected by dietary linoleate than those of heart and liver. Fish fed SO developed severe heart lesions that caused thinning of the ventricular wall and muscle necrosis. The fish fed SO also were susceptible to a transportation-induced shock syndrome that caused 30{\textbackslash}\% mortality. These results establish that a diet with a low (n-3)/(n-6) ratio can cause changes in fatty acid metabolism that are deleterious to the health of salmonid fish, especially when subjected to stress.},

	abstract = {This research examined the haematological and immunological responses of quadruplicate groups of juvenile (similar to 400 g initial weight) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) that had each been fed daily to satiation for 12 weeks one of three high-energy extruded diets of identical composition except for the supplemental dietary lipid (234.7 g kg(-1)) source. The three experimental diets varied in the composition of supplement lipid; diet 1 contained 100{\textbackslash}\% anchovy oil (AO), while diets 2 and 3 replaced 29.8{\textbackslash}\% and 59.7{\textbackslash}\% of the AO (respectively) with a 1:1 blend of canola oil (CO) and poultry fat (PF). Immediately following the feeding trial, a random sample of fish from each diet was sampled for determination of baseline levels of various haematological and immunological parameters. Thereafter, duplicate diet groups were vaccinated (against Listonella anguillarum) and reared on their respective experimental diets for an additional 4 weeks. At that time, the remaining fish were sampled similarly, and the different parameters were measured again. Comparisons between the different diet treatment groups were made before and after vaccination. There were no significant diet treatment effects at either sample time, for haematocrit, differential leucocyte counts, erythrocyte counts, serum hemolytic activity or head kidney leucocyte respiratory burst activity. The fish fed diet 1 however, did show significantly higher post-vaccination levels of peripheral blood leucocyte respiratory burst activity and higher serum antibody titres against L. anguillarum. The results suggest that the relatively low n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios in the muscle and presumably other tissues of fish fed diet 1, may have resulted in a reduced production of immunocompromising eicosanoids than were produced in fish ingesting the other two diets that were based in part on the different amounts of the CO and PF blend. Long-term studies are required to confirm this possibility.},

	abstract = {An individual-tree diameter growth model was developed for Cunninghamia lanceolata in Fujian province, southeast China. Data were obtained from 72 plantation-grown China-fir trees in 24 single-species plots. Ordinary non-linear least squares regression was used to choose the best base model from among 5 theoretical growth equations; selection criteria were the smallest absolute mean residual and root mean square error and the largest adjusted coefficient of determination. To account for autocorrelation in the repeated-measures data, we developed one-level and nested two-level nonlinear mixedeffects (NLME) models, constructed on the selected base model; the NLME models incorporated random effects of the tree and plot. The best random-effects combinations for the NLME models were identified by Akaike’s information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and 22 logarithm likelihood. Heteroscedasticity was reduced with two residual variance functions, a power function and an exponential function. The autocorrelation was addressed with three residual autocorrelation structures: a first-order autoregressive structure [AR(1)], a combination of first-order autoregressive and moving average structures [ARMA(1,1)] and a compound symmetry structure (CS). The one-level (tree) NLME model performed best. Independent validation data were used to test the performance of the models and to demonstrate the advantage of calibrating the NLME models.},

The curve was generated using the SELECT model on catch-at-length data, obtained by simultaneously towing a New Bedford style dredge and a nonselective National Marine Fisheries Service sea scallop survey dredge from commercial scallop vessels. Data were collected during three cruises in the Northwest Atlantic between 2005 and 2006. The resultant selectivity curve yielded a 50\% retention length of 100.1 mm, a selection range of 23.6 mm, and a value of 0.77 for the efficiency of the commercial dredge relative to the survey dredge. A length of 100.1 mm corresponds to a meat weight of 17.2 g in Georges Bank and 16.8 g in the mid-Atlantic. These results can assist fisheries managers with stock assessments, fishing mortality estimates, and the interpretation of catch data from resource surveys. Additionally, the curve can be used as a baseline to evaluate the effect of future changes to sea scallop dredge configuration.},

The sea scallop rotational management plan is based on yield projections estimated from shell height/meat weight relationships. Semiannual spawning may influence yield projections, impacting fishery allocations. This study identifies spawning events at two locations on Georges Bank: one in Closed Area I (CAI) and the other in Closed Area II (CAII). We hypothesize that spawning is semiannual, spring spawning is incomplete compared with autumn spawning, and reproductive stage differs temporally between areas. Scallops (n = 1,871) were collected during a monthly dredge survey in these two areas from two sites from March 2011 through June 2013. Tissues from scallops (shell height ∼130 mm) frozen at sea, were oven-dried and the gonosomatic indices (GSIs) were analyzed to identify spawning events. Oocyte diameter was measured to determine maturity. Bottom temperature was recorded. Semiannual spawning occurred in both closed areas. Spawning rates were similar, but autumn spawning was greater in magnitude than spring spawning. The timing of gametogenesis was similar between sites. Bottom temperature patterns suggest different oceanographic conditions between areas. A semiannual sea scallop reproductive cycle on Georges Bank could influence recruitment and growth assumptions affecting future management decisions.},

Scallops were sampled initially and at 5, 8, and 12 months in order to measure growth, yield, production, and survival. An inverse relationship was found between growth (shell height, meat weight, and whole weight) and stocking density, with a substantial amount of growth occurring at all densities. A similar relationship occurred between stocking density and production (kJ year−1) and yield (g) per individual. Overall survival was 91\% and was not influenced by density. The optimal stocking density for giant scallops is dependent on the overall cultivation strategy and is thus influenced by the desired final market product, market size, type of grow-out technique, and timing of transfer from the pearl nets.},

The two bivalve species were exposed, simultaneously, to four concentrations of seston (1, 3, 7 and 14 mgl−1) at each of three levels of organic quality (25, 50 and 80\%) for several days. Experimental diets consisted of mixtures of microalgae and silica at concentrations typical of those observed in their natural habitats. Absorption efficiency (AE) was not significantly different between scallops and clams. In both species, AE was independent of concentration, and increased as the organic fraction of the seston increased. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were also similar for both scallops and clams, and there was no consistent effect of concentration or food quality on these metabolic processes for either species. Scope for growth (SFG) in both species increased at a decreasing rate with elevated particle concentrations and organic content of the seston until an asymptote was reached. SFG in scallops was equal or exceeded SFG in clams at low concentration, but the opposite was true at high concentrations. Mya arenaria appeared to be better suited than Placopecten magellanicus to cope with higher concentrations of seston, especially if it consisted of relatively poor quality particles.},

Using 96 diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) capable of discriminating between northern and southern clusters, we examined fine-scale genetic structure of scallops among 27 sample locations, spanning the largest geographic range evaluated in this species to date ({\textasciitilde}37-51°N). Here, we confirmed previous observations of northern and southern groups, but we show that the boundary between northern and southern clusters is not a discrete latitudinal break. Instead, at latitudes near the previously described boundary, we found unexpected patterns of fine-scale genetic structure occurring between inshore and offshore sites. Scallops from offshore sites, including St. Pierre Bank and the eastern Scotian Shelf, clustered with southern stocks, whereas inshore sites at similar latitudes clustered with northern stocks. Our analyses revealed significant genetic divergence across small spatial scales (i.e., 129-221 km distances), and that spatial structure over large and fine scales was strongly associated with temperature during seasonal periods of thermal minima. Clear temperature differences between inshore and offshore locations may explain the fine-scale structuring observed, such as why southern lineages of scallop occur at higher latitudes in deeper, warmer offshore waters. Our study supports growing evidence that fine-scale population structure in marine species is common, often environmentally associated, and that consideration of environmental and genomic data can significantly enhance the identification of marine diversity and management units.},

	abstract = {Time-series of hourly clearance, ingestion and absorption rates and absorption efficiency were measured over 48 h for adult sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) held in situ in a coastal embayment in Nova Scotia, Canada, during a wind-induced resuspension event. Temporal variations in oceanographic variables, and seston quantity and composition (organic matter, organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and inorganic particle size spectra) were monitored during the study with moored instruments and hourly water sampling. Resuspension of bottom materials during the storm resulted in large changes in the amount (1 to 30 mg l−1 total particulate matter) and nutritional quality (25 to 50\% organic content) of seston. High sedimentation rates after the storm were accelerated by flocculation, resulting in the rapid settling of resuspended particles and an increase in seston quality. Observed short-term (hourly) fluctuations in clearance rate were not related to storm- or tide-induced changes in seston characteristics but were directly related to flow velocity. Significantly lower clearance rates were observed at relatively low ({\textless}4 cm s−1) and high ({\textgreater}9 cm s−1) flow speeds. The overall reduction in ingestion rates after the storm resulted from decreased food availability. Hourly absorption efficiency (AE) measurements were closely related to seston quality (total organic, organic C and N content) and AE declined exponentially with decreasing seston quality. Reductions in AE during the resuspension event were offset by the increased ingestion rate, resulting in no significant changes in absorption rates for organic matter, C, or N over the sampling period. As the low food quality of the resuspended matter was balanced by increased availability, any physiological regulation of food acquisition (i.e. clearance rate regulation) would have been irrelevant to maintaining food intake constant.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification, the progressive change in ocean chemistry caused by uptake of atmospheric CO2, is likely to affect some marine resources negatively, including shellfish. The Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports one of the most economically important single-species commercial fisheries in the United States. Careful management appears to be the most powerful short-term factor affecting scallop populations, but in the coming decades scallops will be increasingly influenced by global environmental changes such as ocean warming and ocean acidification. In this paper, we describe an integrated assessment model (IAM) that numerically simulates oceanographic, population dynamic, and socioeconomic relationships for the U.S. commercial sea scallop fishery. Our primary goal is to enrich resource management deliberations by offering both short- and long-term insight into the system and generating detailed policy-relevant information about the relative effects of ocean acidification, temperature rise, fishing pressure, and socioeconomic factors on the fishery using a simplified model system. Starting with relationships and data used now for sea scallop fishery management, the model adds socioeconomic decision making based on static economic theory and includes ocean biogeochemical change resulting from CO2 emissions. The model skillfully reproduces scallop population dynamics, market dynamics, and seawater carbonate chemistry since 2000. It indicates sea scallop harvests could decline substantially by 2050 under RCP 8.5 CO2 emissions and current harvest rules, assuming that ocean acidification affects P. magellanicus by decreasing recruitment and slowing growth, and that ocean warming increases growth. Future work will explore different economic and management scenarios and test how potential impacts of ocean acidification on other scallop biological parameters may influence the social-ecological system. Future empirical work on the effect of ocean acidification on sea scallops is also needed.},

Advances in high-throughput sequencing offer new opportunities for estimating marine connectivity. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to examine dispersal and realized connectivity in the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus, an economically important marine bivalve. Based on 245 individuals sampled rangewide at 12 locations from Newfoundland to the Mid-Atlantic Bight, we identified and genotyped 7163 single nucleotide polymorphisms; 112 (1.6\%) were identified as outliers potentially under directional selection. Bayesian clustering revealed a discontinuity between northern and southern samples, and latitudinal clines in allele frequencies were observed in 42.9\% of the outlier loci and in 24.6\% of neutral loci. Dispersal estimates derived using these clines and estimates of linkage disequilibrium imply limited dispersal; 373.1 ± 407.0 km (mean ± SD) for outlier loci and 641.0 ± 544.6 km (mean ± SD) for neutral loci. Our analysis suggests restricted dispersal compared to the species range ({\textgreater}2000 km) and that dispersal and effective connectivity differ. These observations support the hypothesis that limited effective dispersal structures scallop populations along eastern North America. These findings can help refine the appropriate scale of management and conservation in this commercially valuable species.},

We used 7163 SNPs derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing genotyped in 245 individuals of the economically important sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, to evaluate the correlations between oceanographic variation and a previously identified latitudinal genomic cline. Sea scallops span a broad latitudinal area ({\textgreater}10 degrees), and we hypothesized that climatic variation significantly drives clinal trends in allele frequency. Using a large environmental dataset, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and nutrient concentrations, we identified a suite of SNPs (285-621, depending on analysis and environmental dataset) potentially under selection through correlations with environmental variation. Principal components analysis of different outlier SNPs and environmental datasets revealed similar northern and southern clusters, with significant associations between the first axes of each (R2adj = .66-.79). Multivariate redundancy analysis of outlier SNPs and the environmental principal components indicated that environmental factors explained more than 32\% of the variance. Similarly, multiple linear regressions and random-forest analysis identified winter average and minimum ocean temperatures as significant parameters in the link between genetic and environmental variation. This work indicates that oceanographic variation is associated with the observed genomic cline in this species and that seasonal periods of extreme cold may restrict gene flow along a latitudinal gradient in this marine benthic bivalve. Incorporating this finding into management may improve accuracy of management strategies and future predictions.},

During the dissection process we recorded the shell height, meat weight, sex, gonad weight, and visceral tissue weight. Meat weight was regressed against shell height (Ln(MW) = α β ln SH). Predicted meat weight varied by up to 29\% for a 120 mm shell height scallop among months. Scallop meat weight varied by 31\% for a 120 mm shell height scallop between areas in the same month. The Southern Flank of Georges Bank had a different pattern of monthly variation in meat weight, possibly because of a spring spawning event observed in the gonadal indices. These spatial and temporal differences in meat weight could affect harvest, and harvest rate, with a 22\% difference in scallops harvested between June and October calculated from a hypothetical fishery. Understanding these spatial and temporal variations in the shell height/meat weight relationship is important for optimal harvest, especially if a fully rotational area management strategy is implemented.},

Concentrations of natural suspended particles at our study site were {\textless} 5 mg I-', and chlorophyll a concentrations were {\textless} 1.4 pg mg-'. Under these seston quantities and qualities, clearance rates were positively correlated with the total amount of chlorophyll-containing particles in the water (pg I-'), while ingestion rates increased with increasing concentration of total suspended particulate matter (mg I-'). Scallops were able to select high-quality chlorophyll-a-containing particles and significantly improve the quality of material ingested.

	abstract = {SummaryGonad output, reproductive effort and residual reproductive value are greater in scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) from shallow water, where conditions are more favourable, than in scallops from deep water. Variation between years in these fitness correlates is also greater in shallow water scallops. High reproductive effort is associated with a greater reproductive cost, although in general reproduction in this species appears to be “restrained”, and only in older individuals from shallow water is there evidence of “reckless” reproductive behaviour. Reproductive effort increases as the animal grows older, but residual reproductive value is a maximum at age 4 years, after which it decreases with age owing to greater mortality. Localities vary in their suitability for scallop growth and reproduction, and at one Newfoundland site conditions in shallow water (10 m) are better than those in deep water (31 m). Scallops from the former have a greater fitness than those from the latter. The energy costs of reproduction have implications for life history variability in P. magellanicus, although for a considerable part of its lifetime the scallop is able to maximise gamete production in response to environmental factors (especially the food supply) without trading off reproduction against growth or maintenance.},

To gain insight into the seasonal energy balance for this species, metabolic and clearance rates were measured monthly under ambient temperature conditions and natural seston levels. Stereological techniques were used to determine the gamete volume fraction in the gonad in order to establish the annual reporductive cycle. The less favourable conditions associated with deeper water were relfected in reduced rates of gamete development, but the diameter of spawned eggs and the timing of spawning appeared unaffected by poorer conditions in the natural environment. Estimates of scope for growth were low or negative during the winter, but consistently high during the spring bloom, corresponding to a period of rapid gamete maturation. Somatic weight declined in both populations as gamete development proceeded but increased again during periods of low gametogenic activity, suggesting a close relationship between energy available for growth and the reproductive cycle. Oxygen uptake and clearance rate varied seasonally in relation to ambient temperature and food conditions, all of which appeared to be interrelated in a complex fashion with the energy demands of gametogenesis.},

The majority of particles from each diet were within the size range effectively retained by sea scallops ({\textgreater}5/gmm).

While only a small fraction of the total sediment organic matter was utilized (mean net AE = 9 \%), an average of 50 \% of available nitrogen was absorbed. Resuspended paniculate matter may play an important role in the energy gain and nitrogen demands of this species. Despite the ability of P. magellanicus to efficiently digest “aged” kelp debris, it was consumed at a much lower rate than phytoplankton and did not contribute significantly to the dietary requirements of the sea scallop. These results demonstrate the importance of phytoplankton as a diet for the sea scallop, but indicate that detrital particles can contribute to energy gain during periods when phytoplankton are less available to meet energy demands.},

	abstract = {In situ technologies were employed to monitor suspended particle flocculation and floc settlement and utilization by a cohort of sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) during the 2000 spring phytoplankton bloom in Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada. The objectives were to determine the effect of bloom flocculation and settling on food acquisition and utilization by scallops, and to assess the potential role of flocculation in enhancing the bioavailability of trophic resources and particle-reactive contaminants to bivalve filter feeders. The development and flocculation of the phytoplankton bloom were monitored within the surface layer (10 m depth) by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence and silhouette camera observations. Sedimentation rate, seston abundance and composition, and sea scallop functional responses were monitored at 20 m depth (below the bloom) to provide insight into the potential forcing of feeding and digestion processes by changes in the abundance, composition and properties of the ambient food supply. The bloom began in mid-March and median floc diameter at 10 m depth increased rapidly from 200 μm to greater than 400 μm between 21 and 28 March. Flocs were observed to be abundant in the surface layer up to 4 April. Daily vertical particle flux was high during the last week of March and declined to near zero by 1 April. Clearance rates of scallops held at 20 m depth were relatively high (average±S.D.; 11.7±4.0 L h−1) during the period of bloom settlement and declined rapidly to low levels (0.4±0.9 L h−1) after 31 March. Average absorption efficiency also declined (0.88±0.01 to 0.78±0.05) after bloom settlement. Daily biodeposition rates by scallops were poorly correlated with temporal variations in the quantity (total particulate matter and chlorophyll a concentration) or quality (organic content) of seston available to the scallops, but were significantly correlated with sedimentation rate. Comparison of disaggregated inorganic particle size distributions for suspended particulate matter, settled particles, and scallop feces indicated that fine-grained particles (1 to 4 μm) were effectively ingested by sea scallops—an indication of whole floc ingestion. The settlement of flocs produced during the spring bloom appears to be important in regulating this species physiological energetics and for enhancing the bioavailablility of fine particles (including picoplankton) and particle-reactive contaminants.},

The present study examined length–weight relationships of 1334 haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and 1186 whiting (Merlangius merlangus) collected on a groundfish survey in the waters around Ireland in 2004. Additionally, condition indices were estimated for individual fish and for length-frequency samples in order to summarise the length–weight relationships. The length–weight regression showed a significant area effect but no significant differences existed between the sexes. The condition indices showed a moderate spatial structure for both species: around 25\% of the variability could be explained by the location of the samples, the rest of the variability was due to other sources. Length–weight relationships did not appear to vary significantly within stocks, however differences between stocks were significant. In the present case, a bias of up to 10\% could occur in biomass estimates as a result of applying length–weight relationships of one stock to length data of a neighbouring stock.},

	abstract = {A laboratory flume study was conducted to determine the effects of a variable food supply on sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) clearance rates (CRs). Time course measurements of CRs were made while manipulating either individually, or simultaneously, flow speed and phytoplankton concentration. Variables were altered bi-hourly during 14-h experiments to produce a symmetrical increase (ascending phase), then decrease (descending phase) in food supply; flow speed varied between 5–25 cm s−1 and concentrations of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii between 0.5×103 cells ml−1. In all treatments, CRs in the ascending phase differed from those in the descending phase, indicating an effect of feeding history. Differences between phases were attributed to treatment effects since scallop CRs did not vary significantly when exposed to a constant flow and phytoplankton concentration. In variable flow and constant phytoplankton concentration, CRs in the ascending phase (5–15 cm s−1) of the flow cycle were 30\% lower than in the descending phase (15–5 cm s−1). For both the ascending and decending phase CRs were independent of flow speed. The elevated CRs in the descending phase may have compensated for the period of feeding inhibition which occurred at peak flows (25 cm s−1). Increasing phytoplankton concentrations in constant flow caused a significant decline in CRs, but in the descending phase CRs were reduced by 50\% and independent of concentration. The cause of the reduced CRs in the descending phase is unknown, but it may be related to satiation. When flow speed and phytoplankton concentration were altered simultaneously, there was an interactive effect during the descending phase but not the ascending phase. In the ascending phase (increasing flow and phytoplankton concentration) CRs declined at the same rate as in the constant flow/variable phytoplankton treatment, i.e. rates were independent of flow speed. However, in the descending phase, flow speeds of 15–10 cm s−1 inhibited feeding. Results emphasize that short-term (hours) feeding history is an important component of scallop feeding behaviour, altering the response to changes in food supply. Therefore, the predictive value of functional relationships maybe improved by the incorporation of data on feeding history and the interactive effects of flow speed.},

Bed skin friction immediately upstream, and at one shell diameter downstream of the mimic was 1.2–2.4 times higher than ambient values (8.1 × 10−2 Pa). Directly downstream of the mimic there was a region of near-zero skin friction. Bed diatom density was correlated with changes in skin friction; after 21 h, cell densities were 36–87\% greater in the regions of high skin friction upstream and downstream of scallop than in control experiments. The pattern of bed diatom density about the scallop was similar in the coarse and medium sands, but deposition to the fine bed was not affected by the mimic. Diatom density was significantly correlated with grain diameter; deposition in the coarse bed was 2.3 times higher than in the medium sand, and 7.4 times higher than in the fine sand. A field experiment confirmed that the coarse sand was a greater sink of phytoplankton pigment than the fine sand. Previous studies and scaling arguments suggest that the differences in bed diatom density were controlled by the magnitude of interfacial solute fluxes. Regions of high skin friction about the mimic increased the porewater exchange, resulting in greater concentrations of diatoms retained within the bed. Similarly, the more permeable coarse sand would have a greater rate of porewater exchange than the fine sand, explaining the higher bed diatom density. Differences in the predicted volume of interstitial void space as a function of grain size closely matched the observed differences in bed diatom density. Results suggest that alteration of boundary layer flows by centimetre scale topography such as scallops, increases the flux of particulate organic matter toward the bed, but whether it is retained within the bed, and thus made available to the benthos is dependent on the sediment granularity.},

Scallops are strongly associated with gravel lag deposits, which are readily distinguishable from sand-covered terrain through the use of multibeam backscatter data. There exists a highly significant correlation between scallop survey catch rates and backscatter intensity which can be used for the prediction of scallop stock abundance.

For this study, multiple model-based abundance indices were developed to test the incorporation of environmental covariates in a length-structured assessment of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) stock in the Gulf of Maine – Georges Bank on the possible improvement of stock assessment quality. Comparisons reveal that modelled indices with environmental covariates appear to be more precise than traditional indices, but model performance metrics and hindcasted fishery statuses revealed that these improvements to indices may not necessarily mean an improved assessment. Model-based abundance indices are not intrinsically better than design-based indices and should be tested for each species individually.},

We test these models with simulated data and then apply them to test whether concerns that high density is causing growth suppression of walleye (Sander vitreus) in Alberta, Canada, are supported using data collected during 2000–2017. Simulation experiments demonstrated that models that failed to account for complex dependency structures often resulted in growth rate estimates that were less accurate and biased low as judged by median absolute relative error and median relative error, respectively. The magnitude of this bias depended on the parameter values used for simulation. For the case study, a spatial–temporal model was more parsimonious and had higher predictive performance relative to simpler models and did not support the slow-growing walleye hypothesis in Alberta. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering spatial–temporal correlation in analyses that rely on surveillance-style monitoring datasets, particularly when examining relationships between life-history traits and environmental characteristics.},

Estimating von Bertalanffy growth parameters from growth increment data using a linear mixed-effects model, with an application to the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 2165–2175.We introduce a novel linear mixed-effects method for estimating von Bertalanffy growth parameters from growth increment data that lack explicit age information. The method is simple to implement and can incorporate and estimate variability in both the asymptotic size L∞ and the Brody growth coefficient K. Simulations indicate that estimates from the method are accurate over a range of conditions. The method is applied to growth data from more than 6000 Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) shells from the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank. Sea scallops grow to a larger asymptotic shell height on Georges Bank than on the Mid-Atlantic Bight and in areas closed to fishing on Georges Bank than on the fished portions. Depth and latitude had significant effects on scallop growth in both the Mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank, with smaller asymptotic shell heights in deeper water and at higher latitudes.},

Maximum densities of 1 and 2 yr old individuals, as well a s of adults, were recorded in the northern area of the study. Abundance of scallops was significantly higher on gravel than on the other sediment types. Scallops appeared to exhibit a Poisson distribution within sediment type. Distribution of juveniles only partly matched that of adults; a g e 1 individuals were less dispersed than 2 yr olds and adults, and were mainly located on a gravel-pebble deposit in the northern half of the Bank. It is inferred that movements associated with tidal currents occur as the individuals grow older. The relative abundances of pre-recruits and recruits emphasize the impact of fishing activity on size structure. Growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy function would indicate that Lee's phenomenon acts on the population. Age 2 juveniles showed a strong depth-related decrease in shell growth, linked to temperature and probably to food availability. The sampling technique employed has the potential for establishing pre-recruitment indices for use in management of this fishery.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Condition (the relationship between individual weight and length) has been researched in fisheries science for over 100 yr and is claimed to be an integrated measure of physiological status for fishes. Spatial or temporal variation in condition can contribute to otherwise unexplained variation in the relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment. Individual condition is also included in age-structured population models, which use weight at age to convert population estimates between numbers and biomass. However, no study has analyzed spatial and temporal variation in condition for multiple marine species. Here I apply recent improvements in spatial modeling to analyze coastwide variation in condition for 28 groundfishes in the California Current. I show that, on average, 22\% of individual-level variation in condition can be explained via persistent (constant over time) and annually varying spatial differences in condition, and condition for many species varies 10 to 20\% spatially and among years. While population density, bottom temperature, and calendar date are parsimonious descriptors of condition in several species, the sign of these coefficients varies, and their magnitude is small relative to the magnitude of residual spatial and temporal variation. Additionally, annually varying spatial differences have nearly twice the magnitude of persistent spatial differences in condition. I therefore conclude that dynamic habitat conditions contribute a substantial portion of variation in individual condition for these groundfishes. Spatial and temporal variation in condition will be important for population models that convert between numbers, fishery catch, and population biomass, and may also clarify unexplained variability in productivity for marine fishes.},

On the Canadian side of Georges Bank, landings and discards of transboundary stocks of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua, Haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and Yellowtail Flounder Limanda ferruginea are monitored against quotas that are shared by the Canadian groundfish and scallop (sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries to limit fishing mortality. The shared quota allocations are managed using an adaptive quota management system; quota can be redistributed between the fisheries during the season to maximize fishing opportunities, while still respecting the overall catch limits. However, the redistribution relies on estimates of the total end-of-year discards of Atlantic Cod, Haddock, and Yellowtail Flounder from the scallop fishery. Here, we evaluated and compared two approaches for projecting end-of-year discards within season: an empirical method based on scallop fishery landings and a seasonal modeling approach. Seasonal trends in discards were identified, with discards of all three groundfish species highest in April or May. The seasonal models out-performed the empirical landings-based projection method, and our results demonstrate that accounting for seasonal patterns in discards better informs risk-based fishery management decisions.},

	abstract = {Applied ecology has traditionally approached management problems through a simplified, single-species lens. Repeated failures of single-species management have led us to a new paradigm — managing at the ecosystem level. Ecosystem management involves a complex array of interacting organisms, processes and scientific disciplines. Accounting for interactions, feedback loops and dependencies between ecosystem components is therefore fundamental to understanding and managing ecosystems. We provide an overview of the main types of ecosystem models and their uses, and discuss challenges related to modelling complex ecological systems. Existing modelling approaches typically attempt to do one or more of the following: describe and disentangle ecosystem components and interactions; make predictions about future ecosystem states; and inform decision making by comparing alternative strategies and identifying important uncertainties. Modelling ecosystems is challenging, particularly when balancing the desire to represent many components of an ecosystem with the limitations of available data and the modelling objective. Explicitly considering different forms of uncertainty is therefore a primary concern. We provide some recommended strategies (such as ensemble ecosystem models and multi-model approaches) to aid the explicit consideration of uncertainty while also meeting the challenges of modelling ecosystems.},

The analytical methods for this assessment are based on the 2009 framework of Georges Bank scallops (Jonsen et al. 2009), along with a number of improvements in the areas of growth, mortality and observation error. Annual dredge surveys using stratified random design, where the strata are defined by the historical abundance indices, are conducted on Browns and Georges banks every May and August, respectively.},

	abstract = {Size distribution and swimming activity of the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus, were measured in situ from high-definition video recordings collected by a remotely operated vehicle on a fished scallop bed on German Bank, Gulf of Maine in August 2010. Scallop densities ranged from 0.004 to 3.89 m−2 and shell height (SH) ranged from 16.3 to 193.8 mm. The size distribution was bimodal, with high abundance from 20 to 40 mm SH indicating a recent recruitment event in the area. The low abundance of scallops {\textgreater}100 mm SH was likely due to the active fishery in this area. Of 535 observed swims, 200 were characterized for swim distance, time, velocity and distance travelled per adduction. The size of scallops observed to swim ranged from 18.9 to 99.9 mm SH. Both swim time and swim distance increased linearly with SH, and quadratic relationships were observed between velocity and SH, and between distance travelled per adduction and SH. Swimming velocities peaked at {\textasciitilde} 50 cm s−1 for scallops between 60 and 80 mm, and maximum velocity was 103.2 cm s−1observed for an individual of 64.0 mm SH. Our study provided a unique opportunity to investigate size distribution and associated swimming activity of scallops in their natural habitat, rather than in a simulated study in the laboratory, and at depths not reachable by SCUBA diving.},

	abstract = {Commercially harvested marine bivalve populations show a broad range of population-genetic patterns that may be driven by planktonic larval dispersal (gene flow) or by historical (genetic drift) and ecological processes (selection). We characterized microsatellite genetic variation among populations and year classes of the commercially harvested Arctic surfclam, Mactromeris polynyma, in order to test the relative significance of gene flow and drift on three spatial scales: within commercially harvested populations in the northwest Atlantic; among Atlantic populations; and between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. We found small nonsignificant genetic subdivision among eight populations from the northwest Atlantic (FST = 0.002). All of these Atlantic populations were highly significantly differentiated from a northeast Pacific population (FST = 0.087); all populations showed high inbreeding coefficients (FIS = 0.432). We tested one likely source of heterozygote deficits by aging individual clams and exploring genetic variation among age classes within populations (a temporal Wahlund effect). Populations showed strikingly different patterns of age structure, but we found little differentiation among age classes. In one case, we were able to analyze genetic diversity between age classes older or younger than the advent of intensive commercial harvesting. The results generally suggest spatially broad and temporally persistent genetic homogeneity of these bivalves. We discuss the implications of the results for the biology and management of surfclam populations.},

	abstract = {To reduce the risk of overexploitation and the ensuing conservation and socio-economic consequences, fisheries management relies on receiving accurate scientific advice from stock assessments. Biomass dynamics models used in stock assessment tend to rely primarily on indices of abundance and commercial landings data. Standard practice for calculating the indices used in these models typically involves taking averages of survey tow data over large, diverse spatial domains. There is a lot of variability in the choice of methodologies used to propagate index uncertainty into the assessment model, many of which require specifying it through expert knowledge or prior distributions. Here we propose an alternative approach that treats each individual survey tow as an independent estimate of the true underlying biomass in the stock assessment model itself. This reduces information loss and propagates uncertainties into the model directly. A simulation study demonstrates that this approach accurately captures underlying population dynamics and reliably estimates variance parameters. We further demonstrate its utility with data from the Inshore Scallop Fishery of south-west Nova Scotia. Results show significant improvements in parameter estimation over previous models while providing similar predictions of biomass with less uncertainty. This reduced uncertainty can improve the resulting scientific advice and lead to improved decision-making by fisheries managers.},

	abstract = {Globally, management decisions for recently established invertebrate fisheries are based on limited information. The negative consequences are being realized as now at least one-third of invertebrate fisheries are over-exploited, collapsed or closed. Management of a fishery should be based on abundance and productivity data. This information is often unavailable but in some jurisdictions, spatial distributions are known. A methodology for designating a network of reserves for sedentary invertebrates, using sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) on the Scotian Shelf, Canada is proposed, as a case study. It is assumed that there is a positive relationship between spawner density and per capita population growth rate in sedentary broadcast spawners and that fertilization success declines rapidly at low densities. Protection of high-density habitat would safeguard critical spawner density, especially when the critical density is unknown. Using spatial distribution, a method to identify size and location of reserves designed to protect high-density habitat was developed. First, geographically distinct regional-scale clusters are identified. Within clusters, the characteristic patch scale was determined through spatial autocorrelation analysis. The size of reserves can be set as 50\% of each high-density patch based on an appropriate risk-averse approach. The allocation of reserve size and location is not dependent on results of a numerical circulation model. However, the analysis was refined by using one to predict larval drift patterns, and connectivity among patches. Reserve boxes were then designated to safeguard from 30 to 65\% of each high-density patch. Marine reserves do not work if inappropriately sited. In the absence of any other information, it is argued that siting reserves on high-density areas is an essential and appropriate approach to data-poor invertebrate fisheries management. A high percentage of each high-density patch could serve as risk-averse ‘spatial management’ reference points, and could be modified once replenishment rates are known.

	abstract = {Worldwide, most sea cucumber fisheries are ineffectively managed, leading to declining stocks and potentially eroding the resilience of fisheries. We analyse trends in catches, fishery status, fishing participation and regulatory measures among 77 sea cucumber fisheries through data from recent fishery reports and fishery managers. Critical gaps in fisheries biology knowledge of even commonly targeted species undermine the expected success of management strategies. Most tropical fisheries are small-scale, older and typified by numerous ({\textgreater}8) species, whereas temperate fisheries are often emerging, mono-specific and industrialized. Fisher participation data indicated about 3 million sea cucumber fishers worldwide. Fisher participation rates were significantly related to the average annual yield. permanova analysis showed that over-exploited and depleted fisheries employed different sets of measures than fisheries with healthier stocks, and a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination illustrated that a broad set of regulatory measures typified sustainable fisheries. SIMPER and regression tree analyses identified that the dissimilarity was most related to enforcement capacity, number of species harvested, fleet (vessel) controls, limited entry controls and rotational closures. The national Human Development Index was significantly lower in countries with over-exploited and depleted fisheries. Where possible, managers should limit the number of fishers and vessel size and establish short lists of permissible commercial species in multispecies fisheries. Our findings emphasize an imperative to support the enforcement capacity in low-income countries, in which risk of biodiversity loss is exceptionally high. Solutions for greater resilience of sea cucumber stocks must be embedded within those for poverty reduction and alternative livelihood options.},

	abstract = {Identifying rates of change in the abundance of sea cucumbers under differing management regimes is fundamental to estimating commercial yields, identifying ecological interactions and facilitating management. Here, we review the status of sea cucumber stocks from a range of Pacific Island countries (Samoa, Tonga, Palau, Fiji and Papua New Guinea), some of which have had a moratorium on exports for up to a decade. We use a time-series approach to look at variation in sea cucumber presence, coverage and density from survey and re-survey data. Results give an appreciation of variation between ‘high’ status (less impacted) and depleted stocks. Survey data show marked declines in coverage and abundance as a result of artisanal fishing activity, and although species groups were not lost at a country level, local extirpation and range restriction was noted. Resilience and ‘recovery’ following cessation of fishing varied greatly, both among locations and among the species targeted. Worryingly, even after extended periods of moratorium, the density of some species was markedly low. In many cases, the densities were too low for commercial fishing, and may be at a level where the effective population size is constrained due to ‘Allee’ affects. From these results, we suggest that management regimes presently employed are generally not well aligned with the level of response to fishing mortality that can be expected from sea cucumber stocks. New adaptive, precautionary approaches to management are suggested, which would allow more timely interventions to be made, while refined information on stock dynamics is sought.},

	abstract = {Tropical sea cucumber fisheries follow a predictable pattern of serial depletion. Overfishing is exacerbated in developing countries where management systems lack capacity to control large numbers of fishers influenced by poverty. In contrast, the tropical sea cucumber fishery in Australia's World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is operating in a developed high-income country with relatively few licensed fishers to manage. The development of this fishery is reviewed here in a meta-analysis of catches from 1991 to 2011. The fishery expanded to replace high-value teatfish species (Holothuria whitmaei and H. fuscogilva), fished heavily in initial stages of the fishery, with newly commercialized medium-value species such as burying blackfish (Actinopyga spinea) and curryfish (Stichopus herrmanni). These two species now constitute 80\% of total catch. The annual average catch of burying blackfish was 208 tonnes years 2004–11 and curryfish catches increased rapidly at an average annual pace of 200\% from 2007–11. This serial harvest pattern occurred in the absence of baseline studies and without independent resource assessments, information required to inform relevant harvest predictions and to determine fishery impacts. This situation does not support ecologically relevant and adaptive decision-making in management and the unfolding catch patterns in the GBRMP follow those in low-income developing countries. The missing knowledge and lack of data serve as arguments to support precautionary reductions in harvests and extending fallow periods in fishing zones.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, invertebrate ﬁsheries have expanded in catch and value worldwide. One increasingly harvested group is sea cucumbers (class Holothuroidea), which are highly valued in Asia and sold as trepang or beˆche-de-mer. We compiled global landings, economic data, and country-speciﬁc assessment and management reports to synthesize global trends in sea cucumber ﬁsheries, evaluate potential drivers, and test for local and global serial exploitation patterns. Although some sea cucumber ﬁsheries have existed for centuries, catch trends of most individual ﬁsheries followed boom-and-bust patterns since the 1950s, declining nearly as quickly as they expanded. New ﬁsheries expanded ﬁve to six times faster in 1990 compared to 1960 and at an increasing distance from Asia, encompassing a global ﬁshery by the 1990s. Global sea cucumber production was correlated to the Japanese yen at a leading lag. Regional assessments revealed that population declines from overﬁshing occurred in 81\% of sea cucumber ﬁsheries, average harvested body size declined in 35\%, harvesters moved from near- to off-shore regions in 51\% and from high- to low-value species in 76\%. Thirty-eight per cent of sea cucumber ﬁsheries remained unregulated, and illegal catches were of concern in half. Our results suggest that development patterns of sea cucumber ﬁsheries are largely predictable, often unsustainable and frequently too rapid for effective management responses. We discuss potential ecosystem and human community consequences and urge for better monitoring and reporting of catch and abundance, proper scientiﬁc stock assessment and consideration of international trade regulations to ensure long-term and sustainable harvesting of sea cucumbers worldwide.},

	abstract = {The sustainable management of fisheries has largely relied on stock assessment models that assume stocks are homogeneous throughout their domain. However, ignoring complex underlying spatial patterns can lead to increased risk of failures in management. Utilizing geostatistical approaches in conjunction with a traditional fishery biomass dynamics model, we develop a spatially-explicit modelling framework that treats the underlying population dynamics as spatial processes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this approach reliably estimates variance parameters and accurately captures true patterns of population change. We further demonstrate the utility of our modelling framework in a real setting using data from the Canadian Maritimes Inshore Scallop Fishery. The model captures time-varying spatial patterns in both population characteristics and fishing pressure without explicit knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and retains the ability to scale up to the whole spatial domain with less associated uncertainty than for temporal models. These results lead to improved scientific advice for management, future-proofing of the assessment to shifts in stock productivity and fishing effort, and provide information that can be used to develop more effective management approaches.},

	abstract = {A close relationship between adult abundance and stock productivity may not exist for many marine fish stocks, resulting in concern that the management goal of maximum sustainable yield is either inefficient or risky. Although reproductive success is tightly coupled with adult abundance and fecundity in many terrestrial animals, in exploited marine fish where and when fish spawn and consequent dispersal dynamics may have a greater impact. Here, we propose an eco-evolutionary perspective, reproductive resilience, to understand connectivity and productivity in marine fish. Reproductive resilience is the capacity of a population to maintain the reproductive success needed to result in long-term population stability despite disturbances. A stock's reproductive resilience is driven by the underlying traits in its spawner-recruit system, selected for over evolutionary timescales, and the ecological context within which it is operating. Spawner-recruit systems are species specific, have both density-dependent and fitness feedback loops and are made up of fixed, behavioural and ecologically variable traits. They operate over multiple temporal, spatial and biological scales, with trait diversity affecting reproductive resilience at both the population and individual (i.e. portfolio) scales. Models of spawner-recruit systems fall within three categories: (i) two-dimensional models (i.e. spawner and recruit); (ii) process-based biophysical dispersal models which integrate physical and environmental processes into understanding recruitment; and (iii) complex spatially explicit integrated life cycle models. We review these models and their underlying assumptions about reproductive success vs. our emerging mechanistic understanding. We conclude with practical guidelines for integrating reproductive resilience into assessments of population connectivity and stock productivity.},

This is particularly the case when a stock has remained at historically low biomass despite management intervention and when there is an expectation that there should have been a stock recovery. We outline a weight-of-evidence approach that provides a structured means to evaluate this question. The approach, which scores a range of attributes, was applied to five fisheries from the NW Atlantic and SE Australia, chosen to provide a range of supporting evidence, as well as different potential causal mechanisms for a productivity shift. Given the resulting scores for the example stocks, and whether a productivity shift has been accepted for those stocks, a score of between 7 and 12 indicated a level required for acceptance of a productivity shift. The approach has highlighted areas of future research that would improve individual species scores. It is hoped that the paper will encourage a more systematic examination of potential stock productivity shifts in assessments than has hereto been the case.},

We describe a process for evaluating the influence of spatial structure on the performance of stock assessments. This involves developing a spatial model which includes spatially explicit trends in recruitment, fishing mortality and rates of movement. The model is over-parameterized but provides good fits to the data for snow crab. It was used to simulate data sets to test the ability of a non-spatially structured (aggregate) assessment method in terms of estimating trends in abundance and fishing pressure in the presence of spatial structure. The aggregate assessment method performed well if survey selectivity was well known, but was unable to reliably represent the dynamics of the population without data on survey selectivity.

	abstract = {Fisheries dynamics can be thought of as the reciprocal relationship between an exploited population and the fishers and/or managers determining the exploitation patterns. Sustainable production of protein of these coupled human-natural systems requires an understanding of their dynamics. Here, we characterized the fishery dynamics for 173 fisheries from around the globe by applying general additive models to estimated fishing mortality and spawning biomass from the RAM Legacy Database. GAMs specified to mimic production models and more flexible GAMs were applied. We show observed dynamics do not always match assumptions made in management using “classical” fisheries models, and the suitability of these assumptions varies significantly according to large marine ecosystem, habitat, variability in recruitment, maximum weight of a species and minimum observed stock biomass. These results identify circumstances in which simple models may be useful for management. However, adding flexibility to classical models often did not substantially improve performance, which suggests in many cases considering only biomass and removals will not be sufficient to model fishery dynamics. Knowledge of the suitability of common assumptions in management should be used in selecting modelling frameworks, setting management targets, testing management strategies and developing tools to manage data-limited fisheries. Effectively balancing expectations of future protein production from capture fisheries and risk of undesirable outcomes (e.g., “fisheries collapse”) depends on understanding how well we can expect to predict future dynamics of a fishery using current management paradigms.},

In particular, the relationship between recruitment, spawning stock biomass and environmental factors is still poorly understood, even though this aspect is crucial for fisheries management. Fisheries data are often short, but arise from complex dynamical systems with a high degree of stochastic forcing, which are difficult to capture through classic modelling approaches. In the present study, recent statistical approaches based on the approximation of the attractors of dynamical systems are applied on a large dataset of time series to assess (i) the directionality of potential causal relationships between recruitment and spawning stock biomass and potential influence of sea-surface temperature on recruitment and (ii) their performance to forecast recruitment. Our study shows that (i) whereas spawning stock biomass and sea surface temperature influence the recruitment to a lesser extent, recruitment causes also parental stock size and (ii) that non-linear forecasting methods performed well for the short-term predictions of recruitment time series. Our results underline that the complex and stochastic nature of the processes characterizing recruitment are unlikely to be captured by classical stock–recruitment relationships, but that non-linear forecasting methods provide interesting perspectives in that respect.},

	abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most variable biological processes driving fisheries population dynamics and the characteristics and drivers of the variation differ among stocks. Understanding, describing (modeling), estimating, and predicting (forecasting) this variation is essential to appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management. Most modern stock assessments estimate annual variation in recruitment, particularly those that include age or size composition data. Changes over time are often partitioned into those related to the spawning biomass due to density dependence (the stock-recruitment relationship) and those related to other factors such as environmental conditions. Several methods have been used to model recruitment inside stock assessment models, and they differ by how recruitment is represented and how statistical inference is conducted. Virtual population analyses make few statistical assumptions about recruitment and instead calculate recruitment as the sum of the mortality-adjusted catches of a cohort while surplus production models generally imply a stock-recruitment relationship in their production function. Integrated statistical stock assessment models have modelled recruitment using a stock-recruitment relationship, autocorrelation, a function of covariates, regime shifts, or a combination of these. Statistical inference has typically been conducted using state-space (hierarchical) models, whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods, or inferences are approximated using penalized likelihood approaches, which may not be statistically reliable. All these methods have specific issues that need to be addressed and there are tradeoffs in their use. Future temporal variation also needs to be considered when providing management advice. We review the theory and practice of modelling temporal variation in recruitment in fisheries stock assessment, provide advice on good practices, and recommend important research.},

Traditional parametric stock–recruitment models often poorly fit empirical data, nevertheless they are still the rule in fish stock assessment procedures. We here apply a multi-model approach to predict recruitment of 20 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks as a function of adult biomass and environmental variables. We compare the traditional Ricker model with two non-parametric approaches: (i) the stochastic cusp model from catastrophe theory and (ii) multivariate simplex projections, based on attractor state-space reconstruction. We show that the performance of each model is contingent on the historical dynamics of individual stocks, and that stocks which experienced abrupt and state-dependent dynamics are best modelled using non-parametric approaches. These dynamics are pervasive in Western stocks highlighting a geographical distinction between cod stocks, which have implications for their recovery potential. Furthermore, the addition of environmental variables always improved the models’ predictive power indicating that they should be considered in stock assessment and management routines. Using our multi-model approach, we demonstrate that we should be more flexible when modelling recruitment and tailor our approaches to the dynamical properties of each individual stock.},

	abstract = {Multiple processes act at different stages and different intensities within the timeline between spawning and the age designated as “recruitment”. However, common practice is to model only a single step between spawning stock and recruits. Reasons for this practice include lack of data on the intermediate stages, lack of understanding of the mechanisms and functional form governing intermediate stages, and lack of computational resources to model a multistage process in the appropriate statistical framework. We develop a state-space framework and, using a simulation study, we explore the estimation of multistage stock-recruit functions. We evaluated four different functions (Ricker, Beverton-Holt, Shepherd, and Generalized), and examined the effects on estimation of several factors, including the form of density dependence, the magnitude of measurement error associated with each stage, type of prior on measurement error, and the magnitude of process error between stages. Three-parameter stock-recruit functions (Shepherd, Generalized) correctly identified the form of density dependence in each stage, although the Shepherd model exhibited problems with convergence. Model misspecification resulted in bias, especially in parameters specifying measurement and process error; an informative prior on measurement error improved precision and bias. The Deviance Information Criterion selected the Ricker model too often, even when the true model was Beverton-Holt. Sequential density-dependent stages, even multiple overcompensatory stages, lead to an overall function that appears fairly flat, suggesting that a function capable of producing asymptotic dynamics is a practical default. The common practice of bypassing stages between the first (spawning stock) and the last (recruits) worked reasonably well, except when fitting a Ricker model, most likely because the true function was nearly flat over most of the range of the first stage. An application to data on North Sea herring illustrates that a multi-stage stock-recruit model can generate a stock-recruit function that is intermediate between Ricker and Beverton-Holt models, and that does not match existing three-parameter forms.},

Results indicated that the method used to model SRRs strongly affected the temporal pattern of recruitment projection, and the variations generated by autocorrelated SRRs were more similar to observed patterns. When the population productivity had low-frequency and large-magnitude variations, stochastic SRRs generated greater MSY and FMSY estimates than constant or autocorrelated SRRs, while no consistent pattern of BMSY was detected. In the case studies, stochastic and autocorrelated SRRs produced asymmetric relationships between fishing mortality and yield, with higher risk of overfishing by going beyond FMSY. Overall, our results suggest that caution should be taken when calculating MSY-based reference points in highly dynamic ecosystems, and correctly accounting for non-stationary population dynamics could, therefore, lead to more sustainable fisheries.},

            Recent discussions of healthy and sustainable diets encourage increased consumption of plants and decreased consumption of animal-source foods (ASFs) for both human and environmental health. Seafood is often peripheral in these discussions. This paper examines the relative environmental costs of sourcing key nutrients from different kinds of seafood, other ASFs, and a range of plant-based foods. We linked a nutrient richness index for different foods to life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of these foods to evaluate nutritional benefits relative to this key indicator of environmental impacts. The lowest GHG emissions to meet average nutrient requirement values were found in grains, tubers, roots, seeds, wild-caught small pelagic fish, farmed carp and bivalve shellfish. The highest GHG emissions per nutrient supply are in beef, lamb, wild-caught prawns, farmed crustaceans, and pork. Among ASFs, some fish and shellfish have GHG emissions at least as low as plants and merit inclusion in food systems policymaking for their potential to support a healthy, sustainable diet. However, other aquatic species and production methods deliver nutrition to diets at environmental costs at least as high as land-based meat production. It is important to disaggregate seafood by species and production method in ‘planetary health diet’ advice.},

The main ﬁndings are that overall catches and abundance are by far the most important factors determining emissions, the bigger the catches and the greater the abundance, the smaller the emissions per unit of output. Fuel prices are a distant third factor and technological change has played a minor role in this development. In addition, the importance of diﬀerent factors aﬀecting emissions, varies between vessels depending on types of ﬁshing gear. The results indicate that building up ﬁsh stocks not only increases output but also increases proﬁtability and reduces emissions per unit of output, as long as the ﬁsheries management system preserves incentives for eﬃcient ﬁshing.},

	abstract = {Commercial ﬁsheries are heavily dependent upon the combustion of fossil fuels and as such contribute to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and the concomitant impact on the world’s climate. The fuel use and greenhouse gas intensity of a ﬁshery is a function of several variables. One that has not been previously investigated is the role of ﬁsheries management. Using historical gearspeciﬁc fuel use and landings data, we employ scenarios to examine the potential impact that recent changes in the management of the New England ﬁshery for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) may have on ﬁshery-related fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Speciﬁcally, we consider the direct effect of the seasonal ban of midwater trawling in favor of purse seine and ﬁxed gears within Atlantic herring ﬁshing Area 1A. We also evaluate the indirect effect of reductions to the Area 1A total allowable catch of Atlantic herring on the regional supply of bait and the resulting potential need to import bait herring from Canada. Our results indicate that because of the ﬁve-fold lower fuel intensity of purse seining, relative to midwater trawling (21 L/ton versus 108-118 L/ton), the seasonal ban on midwater trawling has the potential to markedly reduce overall fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the herring ﬁshery. These results indicate that management decisions can strongly inﬂuence energy demands and resulting greenhouse gas emissions of ﬁsheries. We urge those involved with ﬁsheries management to take this into account when developing policy and management measures.},

	abstract = {Compared to a century ago, the world’s ﬁshing ﬂeets are larger and more powerful, are travelling further and are producing higher quality products. These developments come largely at a cost of high-fossil fuel energy inputs. Rising energy prices, climate change and consumer demand for ‘green’ products have placed energy use and emissions among the sustainability criteria of food production systems. We have compiled all available published and unpublished fuel use data for ﬁsheries targeting all species, employing all gears and ﬁshing in all regions of the world into a Fisheries and Energy Use Database (FEUD). Here, we present results of our analysis of the relative energy performance of ﬁsheries since 1990 and provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on fuel inputs to diverse ﬁshing ﬂeets. The median fuel use intensity of global ﬁshery records since 1990 is 639 litres per tonne. Fuel inputs to ﬁsheries vary by several orders of magnitude, with small pelagic ﬁsheries ranking among the world’s most efﬁcient forms of animal protein production and crustaceans ranking among the least efﬁcient. Trends in Europe and Australia since the beginning of the 21st century suggest fuel use efﬁciency is improving, although this has been countered by a more rapid increase in oil prices. Management decisions, technological improvements and behavioural changes can further reduce fuel consumption in the short term, although the most effective improvement to ﬁsheries energy performance will come as a result of rebuilding stocks where they are depressed and reducing over-capacity.},

Due to global warming, externality problems from CO2 emissions have gained increased interest. With two externality problems, a ﬁrst-best optimum can be achieved by using two regulatory instruments. However, solving the open-access externality problem also aﬀects CO2 emissions. By using a bio-economic model covering Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Faroe Islands, it is shown that regulations of the openaccess externality problem have a large eﬀect on both economic performance and CO2 emissions, while an additional CO2 regulation only has minor eﬀects. The second-best solution achieved by only regulating open access reduces emissions by approximately 50\% compared to current ﬁsheries, with the exception of Iceland, which already has a well-developed ﬁsheries management system.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent discussions of healthy and sustainable diets encourage increased consumption of plants and decreased consumption of animal-source foods (ASFs) for both human and environmental health. Seafood is often peripheral in these discussions. This paper examines the relative environmental costs of sourcing key nutrients from different kinds of seafood, other ASFs, and a range of plant-based foods. We linked a nutrient richness index for different foods to life cycle assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of these foods to evaluate nutritional benefits relative to this key indicator of environmental impacts. The lowest GHG emissions to meet average nutrient requirement values were found in grains, tubers, roots, seeds, wild-caught small pelagic fish, farmed carp and bivalve shellfish. The highest GHG emissions per nutrient supply are in beef, lamb, wild-caught prawns, farmed crustaceans, and pork. Among ASFs, some fish and shellfish have GHG emissions at least as low as plants and merit inclusion in food systems policymaking for their potential to support a healthy, sustainable diet. However, other aquatic species and production methods deliver nutrition to diets at environmental costs at least as high as land-based meat production. It is important to disaggregate seafood by species and production method in ‘planetary health diet’ advice.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Horse mussels \textit{Modiolus modiolus} can occur in dense aggregations and form areas of ecological and biological significance. In the Bay of Fundy, Canada, aggregations of horse mussels are associated with flow parallel bedforms, and this area is under consideration for designation as a sensitive benthic area which would provide protective measures. Basic demographic information is required to inform the development of effective conservation and management strategies and although general life-history characteristics of \textit{M. modiolus} are known, detailed quantitative demographic information on this population is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the population structure of horse mussels in the Bay of Fundy and assess change in key demographic characteristics since the last study in this area in 1997/1998. There have been significant changes in the population since 1998: the 2017 population contains larger, older, mature individuals, with significantly more females; 35\% of the current population is over 20 yr of age. Direct evidence that this population has been impacted by bottom-contact fishing gear was also observed. Consistent with \textit{M. modiolus} populations worldwide, this population demonstrates life-history traits (e.g. slow growth rates, late age of maturity, long lifespan) that make it sensitive and susceptible to disturbance. Coupled with the knowledge that this population overlaps with significant fishing activity, this study supports the assumption that this population is vulnerable to bottom-contact fishing and that recovery from adverse impacts would be slow and uncertain.},

	abstract = {An abundance of studies in marine systems have documented species range shifts in response to climate change, and many more have used species distribution models to project species ranges under future conditions. However, there is increasing interest in moving beyond a single-species focus to understand how species redistribution alters ecosystem dynamics via changes in trophic interactions. We employed spatiotemporal models to characterize decadal-scale changes in spatial overlap between the distribution of juvenile walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and the distributions of four of its groundfish predators: arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis and adult walleye pollock. These fishes represent ecologically and commercially important species in a rapidly changing sub-Arctic ecosystem, the eastern Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We then examined whether changes in spatial overlap corresponded to changes in predation, using spatiotemporal models of predator stomach contents. We found marked shifts in spatial overlap between juvenile pollock and two predators (arrowtooth flounder and Pacific halibut) over 34 years, with changes in overlap corresponding to increases in population-scale predation pressure. By contrast, we did not find clear relationships between spatial overlap and predation for Pacific cod and adult pollock, the two predators for which juvenile pollock constitute a much smaller diet proportion. Our findings highlight the complexity of predicting predation dynamics for generalist marine species and suggest a need for better process-based methods for understanding the potential future ecological impacts of coupled species range shifts. However, simple metrics of spatial overlap between relatively specialized predators and their prey offer promise as a means to integrate predictions from species distribution models into ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

	abstract = {The misalignment between the spatial structure of biological stocks and management units can be a potentially significant obstacle to the recovery of collapsed stocks. This study examines how ignoring biological stock structure in habitat modeling can prevent the detection of spatially explicit habitat relationships, using juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) as an example. A recent reevaluation of cod stock structure found that there are likely two separate biological units in the eastern Gulf of Maine (EGOM) and western Gulf of Maine (WGOM) within the current Gulf of Maine (GOM) management unit. These two areas differ in their ranges of depth, bottom temperature, and sediment type, variables that influence habitat use by juvenile Atlantic cod (20–50 cm). When applying a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model within these distinct spatial areas, juvenile cod in the EGOM biological unit were found to occupy wider ranges of habitat, including deeper and colder waters, with larger seasonal differences in overall habitat quality than in the WGOM biological unit. When modeling HSIs over the entire GOM management unit and ignoring biological stock structure, results aligned closely with WGOM trends, but did not identify the same seasonal habitat suitability shifts, and the unique habitat associations in the EGOM were not identified. Juvenile survival may be more important than adult survival and fecundity in rebuilding cod stocks in the GOM, and can increase through the protection of quality habitat. Habitat conservation measures, such as area closures, may be implemented over suboptimal areas if spatially explicit habitat relationships are ignored, failing to slow population declines and further hindering recovery of collapsed stocks such as Atlantic cod.},

Spawner age composition may also affect the probability of high recruitment and so could be relevant to stock recovery. This study examined the relation between early survival, age at maturity, and the demographic composition of spawners in many cod and haddock stocks. Reported measures of fecundity and maturity were used to estimate total egg production for comparison with numbers at age 1 and age at 50\% maturity. The instantaneous rate of population growth (r) was estimated for cohorts from life history tables during periods when spawning biomass was depleted (e.g. \&lt;Bpa) using reproductive and mortality data for stocks. Age-specific survival was found to be far more important than reproductive rate in determining population growth rate. Stocks that experienced low and more variable survival matured early and had a high relative fecundity. Hence, while early maturing stocks have the potential for high population growth following favourable recruitment events, they would not be expected to recover any faster than late maturing stocks because of the generally low early survival rate that they experience. Measures of spawner age diversity and mean age were found to be positively correlated with offspring survivorship in a few cod stocks. However, in general, it appears difficult to infer recovery potential from life history characteristics, which may be expected, given that regional variation in reproductive success will ultimately be expected to shape local reproductive schedules.},

The uncertainty of input data, coupled with the structural uncertainty of complex multi-species models, currently makes the use of absolute values from such models contentious for short-term single-species fisheries management advice. Here, we propose a different approach where the standard assessment methodologies can be enhanced using ecosystem model derived information. Using a case study of the Irish Sea, we illustrate how stock-specific ecosystem indicators can be used to set an ecosystem-based fishing mortality reference point (FECO) within the “Pretty Good Yield” ranges for fishing mortality which form the present precautionary approach adopted in Europe by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). We propose that this new target, FECO, can be used to scale fishing mortality down when the ecosystem conditions for the stock are poor and up when conditions are good. This approach provides a streamlined quantitative way of incorporating ecosystem information into catch advice and provides an opportunity to operationalize ecosystem models and empirical indicators, while retaining the integrity of current assessment models and the FMSY-based advice process.},

	abstract = {A comparative analysis of the fish condition (Fulton’s K) of 10 cod stocks in the north Atlantic in relation to the temperature of their habitat, growth rates and their reproductive potential is presented. It is shown that the cod stocks in the north Atlantic display different levels of mean condition, which is partly due to the different temperature regimes of their habitats. Cod living in colder waters, e.g. Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank stocks, were found to be in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters, e.g. North Sea and Irish Sea stocks. Poor condition causes reduced productivity in terms of slow growth and low recruitment potential. Stocks in better condition display significantly higher weights at age 4 than stocks in poor condition. The a coefficients (function’s slopes) obtained from standardised Ricker’s recruitment–spawning stock biomass (SSB) relationships were defined as indicators for the recruitment potential of stocks. These a coefficients were found to be positively correlated with the mean condition factor of the 10 stocks analysed. This indicates that stocks consisting of individuals in poor condition appear to be very susceptible to reduced recruitment at low SSB, while the stocks that consist of fish in good condition seem to behave more robustly with a higher probability of good recruitment at low SSB. The positive effect of the cod condition on their reproductive potential generally implies that the stocks in good condition in the temperate regions of the northeast and west Atlantic can sustain higher exploitation rates than stocks in poor condition in the colder regimes of the northwest Atlantic (Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank). This is confirmed by the positive relationship established between the estimated biological management reference points Fmed and the mean cod condition factors, as well as by the recent status of these stocks.},

There is a clear lack of general rules regarding the impacts of global warming on biota.

Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature-size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature-Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.},

This conversion of the two-dimensional weight-length relationship into a single statistic results in a loss of information and, in many cases, an inaccurate representation of that relationship. Fulton's condition factor (K) is based on the assumption that the slope of the weight-length relationship is 3.0. The relative condition factor (Kn) is based on the assumption that the slopes of all samples to be compared are equal to some specific value. Relative weight (W r ) is based on the assumption that the slope and the intercept of the weight-length relationship are the same as those in the “ideal” equation. Instead of providing simple, interpretable descriptions of the weight-length relationship in fish populations, all three of these commonly used condition indices have critical flaws that can result in incorrect conclusions. Relative weight is arguably the most misleading of these indices, and its use should be reconsidered before it becomes as misused as Fulton's K. The calculation of estimates of ordinary least-squares regression parameters is a more accurate method of examining the weight-length relationships for fish populations, and I suggest that it is the preferred method for evaluation of fish condition.},

	abstract = {Understanding how marine organisms will be affected by global change is of primary importance to ensure ecosystem functioning and nature contributions to people. This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO₂ levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO₂ levels by IPCC for 2050–2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher 𝑝CO₂ values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using 𝑝CO₂ levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO₂ emission scenarios, we found multiple CO₂-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO₂ and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO₂ levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO₂ exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO₂ levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The importance of increasing temperatures and reduced water mixing in the NW Mediterranean Sea, affecting planktonic productivity and thus fish condition by bottom-up control processes, was highlighted by these results. Endogenous and environmental variables are fundamental in explaining variations in fish condition. Based on more than 20 yr of fish weight and length data, relative condition indices were computed for anchovy and sardine caught in the Gulf of Lions. Classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify endogenous factors affecting fish condition, and to group years of similar condition. Both species showed a similar annual cycle with condition being minimal in February and maximal in July. CART identified 3 groups of years where the fish populations generally showed poor, average and good condition and within which condition differed between age classes but not according to sex. In particular, during the period of poor condition (mostly recent years), sardines older than 1 yr appeared to be more strongly affected than younger individuals. Time-series were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine the effects of oceanographic abiotic (temperature, Western Mediterranean Oscillation [WeMO] and Rhone outflow) and biotic (chlorophyll a and 6 plankton classes) factors on fish condition. The selected models explained 48 and 35\% of the variance of anchovy and sardine condition, respectively. Sardine condition was negatively related to temperature but positively related to the WeMO and mesozooplankton and diatom concentrations. A positive effect of mesozooplankton and Rhone runoff on anchovy condition was detected. The importance of increasing temperatures and reduced water mixing in the NW Mediterranean Sea, affecting planktonic productivity and thus fish condition by bottom-up control processes, was highlighted by these results. Changes in plankton quality, quantity and phenology could lead to insufficient or inadequate food supply for both species.},

A strictly species-centric view of human impacts on ecological communities may conceal important trait changes key to ecosystem functioning and stability. Analyses of body size and community composition data for 326 Northwest Atlantic fish species sampled across {\textgreater} 900000 km2 over three decades revealed a rapid and widespread reduction of body sizes driven by declines within species and changes in relative abundances. The changes were unrelated to species richness but of sufficient magnitude to eliminate biogeographic scale gradients of increasing body size with latitude commonly characterized as Bergmann's rule. These changes have persisted despite reduced potential for intraspecific competition and favorable bottom water temperatures, both of which should lead to increased growth rates. The aggregate body sizes in these Northwest Atlantic fish communities may now represent a mismatch between the environmental variability characteristic of the Northwest Atlantic and the historical body size, life history traits, and productivity of species across this region. We discuss how these changes may jeopardize the potential for recovery of these important temperate/subarctic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {This study examines behavioral and physiological responses of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) adopting alternative life history patterns following a period of reduced growth. We manipulated the growth rates of premigratory and nonmigratory salmon by either reducing food availability or maintaining water at low temperature (4–6°C). A third group of fish was kept at ambient temperatures (12–14°C) and fed ad libitum to provide a control. Fish in both experimental groups exhibited compensatory growth after the manipulation period, even though the manipulations had slowed growth rather than caused mass loss. The timing and duration of compensatory growth were affected by the nature of the constraint and the developmental pathway adopted. Compensatory responses were more persistent and stronger among premigratory fish than among nonmigratory. Fish kept at low temperature did not accelerate growth immediately after transfer to ambient temperatures, but they subsequently grew faster than controls for up to 215 d after the end of the manipulation period. This mitigated the effects of the period of low temperatures, although by the end of the experiment they were still smaller than the controls. Fish on reduced rations showed no such time lag, and they grew significantly faster than controls immediately upon regaining access to full rations. These fish attained the same body size as controls by the end of the experiment (day 215). The manipulations caused fish to reduce their growth in mass more than their rate of skeletal growth, but all fish achieved “normal” mass for their length (as compared to controls) within a week of transfer to full feeding or ambient temperature. The main mechanism underlying compensatory growth rates was apparently the increase of intake rates, although this was insufficient to explain the strong compensation shown by temperature-manipulated fish in the presence of larger (and thus competitively superior) individuals. Instead these fish enhanced their growth rate by apparently increasing the duration of the daily feeding period, and avoiding aggressive interactions. We interpret the observed compensation for periods of slowed growth as indicating that growth rate is normally submaximal and can be increased if the animal has fallen below its expected trajectory; thus premigratory fish may have shown a greater compensation because survival rates during migration are strongly size-dependent.},

We used tritrophic food chains to assess the effects of nutrient-limited phytoplankters (the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina) on herbivorous zooplankters (the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa) and finally zooplanktivores (larval herring Clupea harengus) living on the herbivores. The primary producers� food quality had a significant effect on fish condition. Our experimental phosphorus-limited food chain resulted in larval fish with a significantly poorer condition than their counterparts reared under nitrogen-limited or nutrient-sufficient conditions. Our results show that mineral nutrient requirements of consumers have to be satisfied first before fatty acids can promote further growth. This challenges the match/mismatch hypothesis, which links larval fish survival probability solely to prey availability, and could imply that reduced nutrient releases into the environment may affect fish stocks even more severely than previously believed.},

An earlier study showed that haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) stocks exhibited consistently higher variability and lower reproductive rates compared to cod (Gadus morhua) stocks in the geographic regions where they co-occurred. Thus, cod may have a higher resilience to overexploitation, whereas haddock stocks may be more likely to be rescued by chance strong recruitments events. Since that initial study, the ecosystems and stocks have experienced large structural and functional changes, as well as changes in management practice and ocean warming. Here, we updated the previous earlier analysis with new data and found that despite large changes in the ecosystems explored, the patterns of recruitment variability have persisted. Recruitment variability remains higher in haddock than in cod, and the maximum annual reproduction rate at low spawning stock biomass (SSB) remains higher in cod than in haddock, although the latter difference is now less pronounced. Despite the economic and ecological importance of cod and haddock, and their long history of scientific scrutiny, the persistent difference in their reproductive biology remains unexplained.},

We discuss some of the major efforts to this end which are extant among our institutions. We emphasize current initiatives to implement ecosystem-based fisheries management in the northwest Atlantic, with a focus on how advice based on the natural sciences supports an ecosystem-based approach.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: We tested the hypothesis that recent oceanographic changes associated with climate change in the Northeast United States continental shelf ecosystem have caused a change in spatial distribution of marine fish. To do this, we analyzed temporal trends from 1968 to 2007 in the mean center of biomass, mean depth, mean temperature of occurrence, and area occupied in each of 36 fish stocks. Temporal trends in distribution were compared to time series of both local- and large-scale environmental variables, as well as estimates of survey abundance. Many stocks spanning several taxonomic groups, life-history strategies, and rates of fishing exhibited a poleward shift in their center of biomass, most with a simultaneous increase in depth, and a few with a concomitant expansion of their northern range. However, distributional changes were highly dependent on the biogeography of each species. Stocks located in the southern extent of the survey area exhibited much greater poleward shifts in center of biomass and some occupied habitats at increasingly greater depths. In contrast, minimal changes in the center of biomass were observed in stocks with distributions limited to the Gulf of Maine, but mean depth of these stocks increased while stock size decreased. Large-scale temperature increase and changes in circulation, represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, was the most important factor associated with shifts in the mean center of biomass. Stock size was more often correlated with the total area occupied by each species. These changes in spatial distribution of fish stocks are likely to persist such that stock structure should be re-evaluated for some species.},

	abstract = {Evidence of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on marine ecosystems is accumulating, but must be evaluated in the context of the “normal” climate cycles and variability which have caused ﬂuctuations in ﬁsheries throughout human history. The impacts on ﬁsheries are due to a variety of direct and indirect effects of a number of physical and chemical factors, which include temperature, winds, vertical mixing, salinity, oxygen, pH and others. The direct effects act on the physiology, development rates, reproduction, behaviour and survival of individuals and can in some cases be studied experimentally and in controlled conditions. Indirect effects act via ecosystem processes and changes in the production of food or abundance of competitors, predators and pathogens. Recent studies of the effects of climate on primary production are reviewed and the consequences for ﬁsheries production are evaluated through regional examples. Regional examples are also used to show changes in distribution and phenology of plankton and ﬁsh, which are attributed to climate. The role of discontinuous and extreme events (regime shifts, exceptional warm periods) is discussed. Changes in ﬁsh population processes can be investigated in experiments and by analysis of ﬁeld data, particularly by assembling comparative data from regional examples. Although our existing knowledge is in many respects incomplete it nevertheless provides an adequate basis for improved management of ﬁsheries and of marine ecosystems and for adapting to climate change. In order to adapt to changing climate, future monitoring and research must be closely linked to responsive, ﬂexible and reﬂexive management systems.},

The prevalence and efficacy of methods to account for environmental impacts are not well documented, limiting our ability to adequately respond to future environmental and climate changes for adaptive resource management. In Canada, legislation now requires that environmental conditions are considered in the management of fish stocks, yet the current extent of implementation in assessment processes is poorly understood. We assessed the use of climate, oceanographic and ecological considerations in science advisory processes for 178 stock assessments by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. We evaluated whether these considerations were included in conceptual hypotheses about broad-scale mechanisms, quantitative or qualitative analyses, and the development of management advice on current or future stock status. Conceptual hypotheses were included in 46\% of assessments; quantitative inclusions occurred in 21\% of assessments, while qualitative interpretations appeared in 31\% of assessments; and 27\% of assessments included climate, oceanographic and/or ecological considerations in the advice. Assessments of salmonids, invertebrates and pelagic taxa more frequently made use of environmental data than those for groundfish and elasmobranchs. Comparing our findings with assessments in other jurisdictions highlighted a gap in Canada's ability to respond to environmental changes and a need to develop integrated management approaches, such as regional ecosystem assessments and approaches that combine modelling and empirical analyses, with socio-economic analysis within interdisciplinary teams.},

	abstract = {The appetite for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches has grown, but the perception persists that implementation is slow. Here, we synthesize progress toward implementing EBFM in the United States through one potential avenue: expanding fish stock assessments to include ecosystem considerations and interactions between species, fleets, and sectors. We reviewed over 200 stock assessments and assessed how the stock assessment reports included information about system influences on the assessed stock. Our goals were to quantify whether and how assessments incorporated broader system-level considerations, and to explore factors that might contribute to the use of system-level information. Interactions among fishing fleets (technical interactions) were more commonly included than biophysical interactions (species, habitat, climate). Interactions within the physical environment (habitat, climate) were included twice as often as interactions among species (predation). Many assessment reports included ecological interactions only as background or qualitative considerations, rather than incorporating them in the assessment model. Our analyses suggested that ecosystem characteristics are more likely to be included when the species was overfished (stock status), the assessment is conducted at a science centre with a longstanding stomach contents analysis program, and/or the species life history characteristics suggest it is likely to be influenced by the physical environment, habitat, or predation mortality (short-lived species, sessile benthic species, or low trophic-level species). Regional differences in stomach contents analysis programs may limit the inclusion of predation mortality in stock assessments, and more guidance is needed on best practices for the prioritization of when and how biophysical information should be considered. However, our results demonstrate that significant progress has been made to use best available science and data to expand single-species stock assessments, particularly when a broad definition of EBFM is applied.},

	abstract = {Understanding the status of fish stocks is a critical step in ensuring the ecological and economic sustainability of marine ecosystems. However, at least half of global catch and a vast majority of global fisheries lack formal stock assessments, largely due to a lack of sufficient data. Catch data, loosely referring to any catch records be it inclusive of discards or not, are the only type of fishery data available across a wide range of fisheries at a global scale. This has given rise to a long list of so-called “catch-only” models, intended to estimate aspects of stock status based primarily on characteristics of a fishery's catch history. In this paper, we review the history, performance and potential of “catch-only” models to estimate stock biomass status. While individual catch-only models often report good performance, repeated efforts to examine the performance of these models have consistently found them to be imprecise and biased when applied to new data-limited fisheries. We demonstrate that a large reason for this is the simple lack of information on stock status contained in the shape of a catch history alone. Off-the-shelf use of catch-only models can lead to poor and biased estimates of stock status, potentially hindering efforts at effective management.},

	abstract = {Sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) are a highly fecund species that supports one of the most commercially valuable fisheries in the northeast U.S. continental shelf region. Scallop landings exhibit significant interannual variability, with abundances widely varied due to a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors. By coupling a pelagic-stage Individual-Based scallop population dynamics Model (hereafter referred to as Scallop-IBM) with the Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS) and considering the persistent aggregations over Georges Bank (GB)/Great South Channel (GSC) as source beds, we have examined the dispersion and settlement of scallop larvae over 1978–2016. The results demonstrated that the significant interannual variability of larval dispersal was driven by biophysical interactions associated with scallop larval swimming behaviors in their early stages. The duration, frequency, and stimulus of larval vertical migration in the ocean mixed layer (OML) affected the residence time of larvae in the water column over GB. It thus sustained the persistent aggregations of scallops in the GB/GSC and Southern New England region. In addition to larval behavior in the OML, the larval transport to the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) was also closely related to the intensity and duration of northeasterly wind in autumn. There was no conspicuous connectivity of scallop larvae between GB/GSC and MAB in the past 39 years except in the autumn of 2009. In 2009, the significant larval transport to the MAB was produced by unusually strong northeasterly winds. Ignoring larval behavior in the OML could overestimate the scallop population’s connectivity between GB and the MAB and thus provide an unrealistic prediction of scallop larval recruitment in the region. Both satellite-derived SST and NECOFS show that the northeast U.S. shelf experienced climate change-induced warming. The extreme warming at the shelfbreak off GB tends to intensify the cross-isobath water temperature gradient and enhance the clockwise subtidal gyre over GB. This change can increase the larval retention rate over GB/GSC, facilitating enhanced productivity on GB.},

	abstract = {Larval Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) simulations in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) from 2006 to 2012 were performed to investigate annual and inter-annual dispersal and connectivity patterns among stock regions. These simulations used a circulation model based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and an individual-based larval model (IBM) that included larval behavior. The circulation model used realistic dynamical forcing (e.g., winds, tides, and open ocean boundary conditions), thermo-dynamical fluxes (e.g., solar radiations, sensible and latent heating), and hydrological forcing; the larval IBM included vertical swimming and sinking behaviour, temperature-dependent growth, and settlement. Simulated larvae that reach settlement size and suitable habitat in 45 days are considered ‘successful’, and two regions are considered ‘connected’ by larval dispersal when larvae successfully disperse from one region to the other. In general, simulated larval dispersal patterns varied seasonally (28\% higher in September and October compared to May and June), among years (2007 through 2009 had 5\% lower larval success during August and September compared to other years), and spatially, with larvae released from the northern regions like Long Island acting as a substantive larval source with 14\% greater dispersal success and 15\% greater connectivity with other regions than those released elsewhere. Over the seven years simulated, the MAB scallop stocks showed high rates of connectivity to regions to the south and more limited and variable connectivity to regions to the north. In species like sea scallops with limited adult mobility, larval dispersal supplies recruits, enables range expansion, and connects populations. Thus, appreciation of dispersal patterns are essential for fishery management of this economically valuable stock.},

The vessels conducted a fishery-independent sea scallop dredge survey of the MidAtlantic sea scallop resource in 2015. Surveys have continued since 2015 using a multivessel approach, and understanding the implications of a potential vessel effect on scallop catch is important for management and assessment of the resource. Surveys are conducted yearly to support annual fishery specifications and contribute biological and catch data for stock assessments. Generalized linear models tested for an effect of vessel on the total number of scallops captured and indicated survey strata and rotational area were significant predictors. Generalized additive mixed models tested for a vessel effect on scallop catch-at-length with length, vessel, strata, rotational area, and an interaction of vessel and length as fixed effects and survey station as a random effect. Two preferred GAMM were identified for the catch-at-length analysis. One model indicated that strata and rotational area had significant effects on scallop catch-at-length, whereas the interaction term was not significant. The second model did not include the interaction term or vessel as a predictor. Results presented here are consistent with previous calibration studies conducted for scallop dredge surveys suggesting that scallop catch is robust to the effect of vessel and support the use of a suite of industry vessels in the VIMS sea scallop surveys.},

	abstract = {The catch efficiency of towed fishing gears is the fraction of the target species in the gear path that were caught and retained. Catch efficiency is fundamental for calculating population status required for establishing fisheries management reference points. Consequently, catch efficiency has been estimated for many commercially important scallop (Pectinid) fisheries. This article synthesizes and discusses estimates of catch efficiency of towed gears used to target scallops, the methods for estimating catch efficiency and the factors that influence these estimates. There exists considerable variation in catch efficiency estimates among studies (0.1 to 0.7), and it is important that this variation is accounted for during surveys and stock assessments to avoid erroneous advice and estimates. The high variation was driven by differences in experimental conditions, estimation methods and scallop behavior. Scallop size and substrate type were the two most common reporting categories discussed in the studies and consequently should be considered the two most important drivers of catch efficiency. Other important factors such as gear specifications, and scallop species were featured in some studies. This review will be highly useful for designing catch efficiency experiments, survey design and stock assessments by understanding, and accounting for, catch efficiency variation.},

	abstract = {Ecologists and fisheries scientists are faced with forecasting the ecological responses of non-stationary processes resulting from climate change and other drivers. While much is known about temporal change, and resulting responses vis-à-vis species distributional shifts, less is known about how spatial variability in population structure changes through time in response to temporal trends in drivers. A population experiencing decreasing spatial variability would be expected to be more evenly spatially distributed over time, and an increasing trend would correspond to greater extremes or patchiness. We implement a new approach for modelling this spatiotemporal variability in the R package sdmTMB. As a real-world application, we focus on a long-term groundfish monitoring dataset, from the west coast of the USA. Focusing on the 36 species with the highest population densities, we compare our model with dynamic spatiotemporal variance to a model with constant spatiotemporal variance. Of the 36 species examined, 13 had evidence to support increasing patchiness, including darkblotched rockfish, lingcod, and petrale sole. Species appearing to be more uniformly spatially distributed over time included: Dover sole, Pacific ocean perch, and Dungeness crab. Letting spatiotemporal variation change through time generally results in small differences in population trend estimates, but larger estimated differences in precision.},

For too long, Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic and their knowledges have not been equitably included in many research activities. We argue for systematic change in how research-related activities are conducted in the Arctic.

The co-production of knowledge framework that we forward is designed to assist researchers, decision makers, and communities in moving toward those goals. Given increased interest in the Arctic by the research community, the complex, rapid, and ongoing change in Arctic systems, and amidst renewed and urgent calls for equity globally and across all spheres of life, adoption of a co-production of knowledge framework for the conduct of Arctic research is timely as well as a moral and intellectual imperative.

We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights.

	abstract = {Introduction: The concept of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), along with synonymous or closely related terms like indigenous knowledge and native science, has some of its origins in literatures on international development and adaptive management. There is a tendency to want to determine one definition for TEK that can satisfy every stakeholder in every situation. Yet a scan of environmental science and policy literatures reveals there to be differences in definitions that make it difficult to form a consensus. What should be explored instead is the role that the concept of TEK plays in facilitating or discouraging cross-cultural and cross-situational collaboration among actors working for indigenous and non-indigenous institutions of environmental governance, such as tribal natural resources departments, federal agencies working with tribes, and co-management boards.
Methods: This is a philosophical paper that explores how the concept of TEK is defined in science and policy literatures and what purpose it serves for improving cooperative environmental and natural resources stewardship and management between indigenous and non-indigenous institutions. The philosophical method applied here is one that outlines numerous possible meanings of a concept (TEK, in this paper) and the implications of each meaning for science and policy.
Results: In science and policy literatures, there are different definitions of TEK. Controversy can brew over TEK when people hold definitions that are based on different assumptions. There are two kinds of assumptions about the meaning of TEK. The first kind refers to assumptions about the mobilization of TEK, or what I call knowledge mobilization. The second kind involves assumptions about how to understand the relationship between TEK and disciplines like ecology or biology, or, in other words, the relation between TEK and science. Different positions that fall under the two kinds of assumptions (knowledge mobilization; TEK and science) can generate disagreements because they imply differences about “whose” definition of TEK gets privileged, who is counted as having expert authority over environmental governance issues, and how TEK should be factored into policy processes that already have a role for disciplines like forestry or toxicology in them.
Conclusions: In light such disagreements, I argue that the concept of TEK should be understood as a collaborative concept. It serves to invite diverse populations to continually learn from one another about how each approaches the very question of “knowledge” in the first place, and how these different approaches can be blended to better steward natural resources and adapt to climate change. The implication is that environmental scientists and policy professionals, indigenous and non-indigenous, should not be in the business of creating definitions of TEK. Instead, they should focus more on creating long term processes that allow the different implications of approaches to knowledge in relation to stewardship goals to be responsibly thought through.},

	abstract = {Commercial fishing supports coastal communities around the world and fishing livelihoods are often interwoven into local societies, including culture, identity, knowledges, and economies, particularly for many Indigenous Peoples globally. Through a case study with co-management board members in Nunatsiavut, Labrador, Canada, we explore how access to commercial fisheries is a determinant of Inuit well-being. Interviews with fisheries comanagers were conducted and analysed deductively and inductively using a conceptual well-being framework to characterize the ways in which commercial fisheries intersect with Inuit well-being. Our results highlight how commercial fisheries in Nunatsiavut have been a longstanding way of life, with multiple familial connections, and are interwoven with the social, economic, and political components of Indigenous culture and identity. Participants described how the fishing livelihood in Nunatsiavut was put at risk due to overfishing by foreign fleets who exploited Inuit waters during the cod fishery’s formative years. Extensive narrative about fisher committees and community organizing highlighted how political participation and self-determination efforts in the 1970 s led to a measure of sustainability through new Northern Shrimp access. Despite periodic success stories, the Inuit commercial fishery remains in a social struggle. The results show how the fishery has continued with multiple injustices and forms of inequity. The combination of events over time, shared through stories, highlight that these small-scale Inuit fisheries were subject to ocean grabbing or ocean dispossession. Based on these results, future research that facilitates an Inuit vision of Nunatsiavut’s fishing sector is critical, and reclamation policies that facilitate new pathways forward for reconciliation to centre Inuit well-being are needed. Furthermore, these results illustrate how Inuit identified well-being indicators could be adopted for immediate baseline monitoring and to measure progress.},

Here, we employ such methodologies to improve collective understanding of the state and future of wild Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and fish–people–place relationships across British Columbia’s three largest salmon-producing rivers: the Fraser, Skeena, and Nass. Through partnerships with 18 communities of “Salmon People” and semi-structured interviews with 48 knowledge holders (i.e., Elders), we learned that, on average, Elders spent more than half of a century actively engaged in salmon fishing and processing. Modern salmon catches are reported to be approximately one-sixth of what they were estimated to be five to seven decades ago, and the top five threats to salmon identified by Elders included (i) aquaculture, (ii) climate change, (iii) contaminants, (iv) industrial development, and (v) infectious diseases. Threat priorities varied regionally, reflecting distinct lived experiences and regional variation in the prevalence and impact of different threats. Elders perceived threats to salmon equally as threats to aquatic health and human well-being, with evidence that the relationships between people and water, and salmon and people, are being profoundly transformed.},

Effective models for the ethical incorporation of Indigenous knowledge into environmental governance in Canada have remained elusive despite decades of attempts. The predominant research paradigm of “incorporating” Indigenous knowledge into environmental governance is one of extraction by the external interests who seek to include specific aspects of such knowledge in their undertakings. This approach continues to fail because Indigenous knowledge exists as an integral component of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS). It is often hollow and potentially damaging to consider any knowledge without understanding the societal systems and peoples that produced it. Indigenous knowledge is not just “knowledge” (a noun) but a way of life, something that must be lived (a verb) in order to be understood.  Indigenous knowledge is inseparable from the people who hold and live this knowledge. Although government policy and legislation have evolved in attempts to treat Indigenous knowledge more holistically, the overriding paradigm of extraction remains essentially unchanged.  Even the most recent frameworks will meet with limited success as a result. Appropriate and effective inclusion of Indigenous knowledge requires recognition of the systems that support it, which in turn necessitates support for Indigenous self-determination.},

	abstract = {Canada’s constitution grants indigenous people priority access to marine resources, yet indigenous, commercial and recreational fishers target the same species. Avoiding conflict between different users, therefore, requires evidence-based policies that manage fisheries for conservation while respecting indigenous rights. From 2006 to 2015, Canada’s Conservative government demoted the role of science in resource management, stifling research by federal agencies like Fisheries and Oceans Canada. To address ensuing data gaps, during 2014–2015 the Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xai’Xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv First Nations conducted coordinated research on Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), a culturallysignificant resource. These indigenous groups are experiencing declining catch rates of Dungeness crab and postulate that commercial and recreational fisheries are primary causes of local declines. Accordingly, they applied indigenous laws and declared spatial fishery closures for commercial and recreational fishers at 10 sites (closed) while allowing exploitation by all users to continue at 10 other sites (open). Sampling occurred repeatedly over time and analyses compared temporal trends in population characteristics between closed and open sites. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that fisheries decrease the abundance and size of exploited species, but spatial protection can reverse these effects. The body size and catch-per-unit effort of legal-sized males increased over time at closed sites but declined at open sites. Importantly, fishery status did not affect temporal changes in the relative abundance of unfished classes of crab – sublegal males and females – which is logically consistent with the hypothesis. Our study demonstrates that indigenous governance can create spatial closures for conservation and research when Canada’s government fails to do so. Long-term solutions, however, require collaboration in research and management between federal and indigenous governments. Towards that end, Canada’s newly elected Liberal government has begun to restore federal science and to address indigenous rights, thereby enhancing the possibility of such collaboration.},

Cultural goals—which are compatible with biodiversity conservation—were emphasized by Indigenous peoples, and ecological goals were prevalent in state-led marine protected areas. Achievement of at least some cultural goals was the most common mention of success, whereas social issues were the most common challenge.

	abstract = {Abstract Increasingly, fisheries researchers and managers seek or are compelled to “bridge” Indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific approaches to understanding and governing fisheries. Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw) embraces “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,” as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative—central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis essay explores shifting scientific understandings of fish and the evolution of fisheries science, and it grapples with colonialism as a system of power. We trace the rise of fisheries science to a time when Western nation-states were industrializing fishing fleets and competing for access to distant fishing grounds. A theory of fishing called ?maximum sustainable yield? (MSY) that understands fish species in aggregate was espoused. Although alternatives to MSY have been developed, decision-making continues to be informed by statistical models developed within fisheries science. A challenge for structured management systems now rests in attending to different systems of knowledge and addressing local objectives, values, and circumstances. To deepen and illustrate key points, we examine Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and the expansion of commercial herring fisheries and state-led management in British Columbia, Canada. A feedback between colonialism and fisheries science is evident: colonialism generated the initial conditions for expansion and has been reinforced through the implementation of approaches and tools from fisheries science that define and quantify conservation in particular ways. Some features may be unique to the herring illustration, but important aspects of the feedback are more broadly generalizable. We propose three interconnected goals: (a) transform the siloed institutions and practices of Western science, (b) reimagine and rebuild pathways between information (including diverse values and perspectives) and decision-making, and (c) devolve governance authority and broaden governance processes such that multiple ways of knowing share equal footing.},

This requires the communication of the details of a mathematical model, including the use of mathematical notation to represent ecological variables, parameters and processes. In our experience, the clarity of mathematical notation varies between papers and can often be inconsistent with general conventions. Poor notation can impede communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more complicated than necessary. Here, we present some guidelines, including: (a) define every term in an equation, (b) use fonts appropriately (italicise mathematical symbols, use bold lower case for vectors and bold upper case for matrices), (c) use subscripts appropriately (to index quantities, for example, by year), (d) use superscripts appropriately (to indicate a power, the transpose of a matrix or the steady-state value of a quantity), (e) avoid multiletter variable names, and (f) revisit notation early on in a project to see if it should be refined. Although we focus mainly on ecology, our guidelines should be of interest to researchers applying models in evolutionary biology and broader areas of biology.},

There are software packages available to analyse these datasets, but many of them require advanced coding skills. There is a growing need for easy-to-use packages that researchers can use to analyse common ecological datasets. We develop a particular generalized linear mixed model framework for spatio-temporal point-referenced data that is flexible enough to accommodate data from most ecological surveys while being structured enough to facilitate analyses without advanced coding. Our implementation in the starve package uses a computationally efficient version of a nearest-neighbour Gaussian process enabling analysis of relatively large datasets. A tutorial analysis of a Carolina wren survey presents a recommended workflow for analyses while showcasing the capabilities of the package. Our model and package are tools that can easily be added to researchers' routine to help make sense of data from ecological surveys. We emphasize the ability of our model to create fine-scale spatio-temporal predictions which can then be used to visualize and identify important trends in species distributions.},

	abstract = {Area closures allow fish and shellfish populations and associated habitats to recover from the effects of fishing. Determining the appropriate duration of rotational management closures for the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery requires information on both the recovery of scallop populations for subsequent harvest and the resiliency of marine benthic ecosystems for conservation objectives. Here, the effects of scallop fishing on the benthic communities of the northern edge of Georges Bank were examined with a control-impact environmental study comparing an area that had been closed to fishing for over 20 y to an area continually fished. Substrate composition, faunal density, and taxonomic richness data were collected using drop camera surveys. These areas have similar substrate composition, mostly cobble and gravel. Sediment in the control area shifted to larger particle sizes over time, whereas the sediment in the impact area remained the same, suggesting fishing activity prevented this shift in the impact area. Comparing survey stations of like substrate showed that as fishing effort subsided from 2015 to 2017, there was a marked recovery of taxonomic richness and abundance in the impact area. The impact and control areas shifted in a similar manner but varied in the intensity of the shift. This suggests the benthic communities in this area of Georges Bank were relatively resilient to the effects of fishing effort with mean densities of all categories recovering within 2 years.},
