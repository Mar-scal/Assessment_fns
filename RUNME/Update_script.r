## GEORGES A AND BROWNS BANK NORTH.  This is a simple script to call the model functions and run the update for offshore.

## Created by DK April 2016

#####################
#### IS IT STILL BEFORE 2018?? IF SO NOTE, LOOOK HERE!!, NOTE!!  HEADS UP!! YO YO, HOLD UP!! FAIS ATTENTION!! ACHTUNG!! CUIDADO!!!!!
####  IF YOU HAVE SWTICHED FROM R3.2.5 OR LOWER TO R3.3 OR HIGHER YOU WILL NEED TO RE-INSTALL JAGS
